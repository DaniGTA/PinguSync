(Which needs to happen there can be a high demand for it in the coming years.)\n\nVoice actors make the show for me as it has a very wonderful cast.\n\nOverall it`s a must see for anime and a must read in for the manga.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"395002\">You wanna get a buddy to watch anime? Then this is the one you get them to watch!\n\nFrom the start of the OP (Which kicks ass btw) its easy to tell this is going to a thrill ride of emotion. Its VERY violent and does an amazing job portraying the atrocities of war.\n\nMost stories that center around a group of people, usually try to sell you their perspective in the light of positivity.. This is FAR from reality in this anime. The good guys are BAD people and it REALLY wants you to know that.\n\nIf you are looking for something different, gritty, that doesn`t really care about you feelings, then look no further. Late to the party, but this was REALLY worth the wait. Easily a contender for Anime of 2019 for me. Simply glorious!! Please DO NOT miss out on this one.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"173070\">The animation in this series is rivaled by few. Subtle decisions in how to portray something, an emotion, a reaction, when done correctly have an incredible effect.\n\nThere were many different ways this series could have gone, and many storylines that could have been explored. So many of them were simply cut short, as would happen with real life in this era. The simple raw results of simple actions is what this series portrays.\n\nSome characters received way more attention than I thought they would and others far less. This definitely makes the series seem like it isn`t focused on one particular character, but more their interactions and the results of their actions upon this world.\n\nIt`s gruesome. The creators did their job magnificently. I`m a little disappointed with how some things turned out, but to be able to even elicit that emotion from a series is impressive.\n\nWorth every moment.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"545232\">Every few years, a new masterpiece emerges. This is one of them. Away from shounen nonsense and bad seinen stories, this anime is great.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"432650\">This is a deconstruction of humanity through an action-punctuated anime -- similar to the best there is. I think it`s fair to say, even at the 18th episode, the writer, director, and all the people working on this have proven their worth of your time. It`s one of the best.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"73747\">Vinland Saga does a great job depicting the era of Vikings with war, politics and the lifestyle.  The majority of the characters are solid, especially Askeladd, he was an awesome character.  However, my only complaint would be Thorfinn (assassin kid), I was really hoping he would develop as the series progressed, but he remains the same.  The story is the most compelling aspect of this series so I hope there is a 2nd season as the last episode had many developing arcs.  Check this out for a great story of multiple characters.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"367685\">Glorious. Enough said.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"194065\">This is definitely a mast see anime. This is definitely one of the strongest anime I`ve ever seen in my several thousand views. Beautiful animation, strong story, difficult fate of people, everything is interesting and without cliches. It can definitely be called a masterpiece of anime without a drop of embarrassment.</recommendation>\n</recommendations>\n<url>https://vinlandsaga.jp/</url>\n<creators>\n<name id=\"34645\" type=\"Work\">Wit Studio</name>\n<name id=\"4014\" type=\"Original Work\">Yukimura Makoto</name>\n<name id=\"8115\" type=\"Character Design\">Abiru Takahiko</name>\n<name id=\"37817\" type=\"Series Composition\">Seko Hiroshi</name>\n<name id=\"21424\" type=\"Direction\">Yabuta Shuuhei</name>\n<name id=\"40358\" type=\"Music\">Yamada Yutaka</name>\n<name id=\"8115\" type=\"Chief Animation Direction\">Abiru Takahiko</name>\n</creators>\n<description>* Based on an action historical seinen manga written and drawn by http://anidb.net/cr4014 [Yukimura Makoto].\nAs a child, http://anidb.net/ch100693 [Thorfinn] sat at the feet of the great http://anidb.net/ch103128 [Leif Ericson] and thrilled to wild tales of a land far to the west.

Well, at least usually. Other people calling themselves pirates are not unheard of, usually focusing on the freedom and romance involved in the piracy-related tropes and cliches. They may or may not be after the One Piece or a spaceship full of diamonds, too, if that`s what they see as treasure. Real-life pirates were extremely common a few centuries ago, and countries even sponsored their own pirates, called \"privateers\", to attack ships with flags of other countries. Nowadays, however, very few actual pirates still exist, and they rely more on terrorism and guerrilla warfare than anything else, demanding ransom in exchange for hostages instead of openly attacking the enemies with their swords. Another, more modern meaning for the word refers to people who illegally download copyrighted works they are not entitled to have a copy of. Be whichever it may, there are pirates around here.

As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>\n<picurl>181651.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1955\" parentid=\"2925\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-05-18\">\n<name>child soldier</name>\n<description>Untrained and as yet immature, children are expediently thrust into the role of warriors to protect god, king, and country.

Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-28\">\n<name>dynamic</name>\n<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: \nPlot Continuity \nHow does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2606\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-05\">\n<name>target audience</name>\n<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-04-29\">\n<name>themes</name>\n<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2609\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-01\">\n<name>original work</name>\n<description>What the anime is based on!

It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>\n<picurl>126792.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2640\" parentid=\"2625\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-06-02\">\n<name>alternative past</name>\n<description>An anime that takes place in an alternative past is an anime that clearly does not belong to the future or the present, and isn`t tied particularly closely to our history, or has ties to our history but only as a premise: there are too many things that don`t make sense for the time-period. In some cases there is futuristic technology present, but the overall setting still feels that of the past. However the setting must still take place on Earth, since we can not know if the history of a fantasy world is an alternate one or not.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2641\" parentid=\"2625\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-05-18\">\n<name>historical</name>\n<description>Historical anime have clear ties to our history and usually occur in a particular epoch.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2749\" parentid=\"2604\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-08\">\n<name>nudity</name>\n<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.\nPeople, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.\nThough the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.\nNudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.\nEspecially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.\nSource: wiki</description>\n<picurl>60576.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2750\" parentid=\"2604\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"500\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-08\">\n<name>violence</name>\n<description>Violence is the use of physical force against oneself or another entity, compelling action against one`s will on pain of being hurt.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2772\" parentid=\"36\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2016-09-04\">\n<name>feudal warfare</name>\n<description>Feudal Warfare is the warfare of the Middle Ages and therefore the setting must take place in a time line similar to that of Middle Ages or its Asian/American counterparts, or in a fantasy world.

Some ethnic groups practice ritual mutilation, e.g. scarification, burning, flagellation(whipping), tattooing, or wheeling, as part of a rite of passage. In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy. Maiming, or mutilation which involves the loss of, or incapacity to use, a bodily member, is and has been practised by many societies with various cultural and religious significances, and is also a customary form of physical punishment, especially applied on the principle of \"an eye for an eye\".\nSource: Wikipedia</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"3040\" parentid=\"6230\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-01\">\n<name>male protagonist</name>\n<description>This anime has a male protagonist.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"3597\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2013-02-26\">\n<name>mythology</name>\n<description>The anime gets inspirations from many forms of mythologies (either Greek, Egyptian, Nord, etc.) to form its story and setting.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"3618\" parentid=\"2613\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-11-14\">\n<name>ocean</name>\n<description>The large bodies of salt water surrounding the continents and islands are a (significant) setting of this anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"3635\" parentid=\"2841\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-01-01\">\n<name>sea battles</name>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"3915\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2010-04-10\">\n<name>child abuse</name>\n<description>Story depicts child abuse, which is a very complex and dangerous set of problems that include child neglect and the physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4064\" parentid=\"6151\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-08-13\">\n<name>CGI</name>\n<description>Computer-generated imagery (CGI) or computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers.

These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term \"splatter cinema\" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.\n[Source: wiki]</description>\n<picurl>32491.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4128\" parentid=\"6233\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2008-07-29\">\n<name>zero to hero</name>\n<description>With his first appearance, this character is getting his ass kicked by nearly everyone, but as the plot continues, through training (mental or physical) or instant power-up, he changes into a killing/fighting/winning machine.\nThe best example: Makunouchi Ippo from Hajime no Ippo series.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4316\" parentid=\"6242\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-11\">\n<name>murder</name>\n<description>To murder means to bring about someone else`s death, by a voluntary act.

Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.\nIn some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to \"finish\", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.\nAn incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"6062\" parentid=\"6233\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-04-05\">\n<name>heroic sacrifice</name>\n<description>\"In order to save the many, the few will need to sacrifice their lives...\" or so this character may think. \nIn a seemingly hopeless situation, against impossible odds, the character does not choose the path of the coward and run, he or she chooses to bravely face the enemy, fully aware that this will mean death.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"6090\" parentid=\"3597\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-17\">\n<name>Norse mythology</name>\n<description>Norse mythology, or Scandinavian mythology, is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period.
