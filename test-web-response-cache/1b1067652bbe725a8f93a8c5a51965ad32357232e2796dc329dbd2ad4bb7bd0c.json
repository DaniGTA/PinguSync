I mean certainly all the events that transpired here came to a full closure with a promise of a meeting in the oh so distant future (10000 class of distant). For a side story it was well made and it didn`t bore me to oblivion. Could I have done without it? Perhaps! But a Danmachi fan I think this is recommended watch for all of us out there enjoying Bell Cranel`s and Co. adventures.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"194184\">I really really liked this movie even if it might be non-canon and a filler.\n\nThe animation and design is gorgeous. Even better than the tv series and OVA up until now (I`m watching chronologically by release date). The soundtrack is gorgeous. I really have to get it and listen to it again.\n\nThe story is great. I like Greek mythology aka tragedy. The ending was unexpected and really made me cry. And I love movies which make me cry. Also it had some funny parts which made me laugh which is appreciated as well. And it was less ecchi than all other series etc. as well.\n\nVery much recommended.</recommendation>\n</recommendations>\n<url>http://danmachi.com/movie/</url>\n<creators>\n<name id=\"720\" type=\"Animation Work\">J.C.Staff</name>\n<name id=\"3389\" type=\"Character Design\">Kimoto Shigeki</name>\n<name id=\"41113\" type=\"Original Work\">Oomori Fujino</name>\n<name id=\"4648\" type=\"Direction\">Sakurabi Katsushi</name>\n<name id=\"27275\" type=\"Music\">Inai Keiji</name>\n</creators>\n<description>* Original story based on http://anidb.net/cr41113 [Oomori Fujino]`s light novel series.\nFar from the dungeon beneath Orario rises a new threat, one the beautiful goddess http://anidb.net/ch98384 [Artemis] has sworn to destroy with the help of her chosen warrior. But this fighter isn`t the renowned http://anidb.net/ch70850 [Ais Wallenstein] or another storied hero of Orario legend. Instead the fate of Artemis` quest falls upon the shoulders of http://anidb.net/ch70852 [Bell Cranel], who must partner with the goddess and stand against the menace lurking in the remains of a distant, ancient city. Although Bell is the ordained champion of Artemis and a member of the goddess http://anidb.net/ch70851 [Hestia]`s familia, their adventure will test every skill and take every ounce of courage that Bell has — and perhaps, along the way, turn him into the hero he has always aspired to be.\nSource: sentai filmworks</description>\n<ratings>\n<permanent count=\"676\">5.79</permanent>\n<temporary count=\"679\">6.95</temporary>\n</ratings>\n<picture>257532.jpg</picture>\n<resources>\n<resource type=\"1\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>20674</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"2\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>37348</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"4\">\n<externalentity>\n<url>http://danmachi.com/movie/</url>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"6\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>Is_It_Wrong_to_Try_to_Pick_Up_Girls_in_a_Dungeon%3F</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"7\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>ダンジョンに出会いを求めるのは間違っているだろうか</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"8\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>5652</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"9\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>359883</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"10\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>21750</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"23\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>danmachi_anime</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"41\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>81101468</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n</resources>\n<characters>\n<character id=\"70850\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2015-05-30\">\n<rating votes=\"347\">7.37</rating>\n<name>Ais Wallenstein</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Title: Sword Princess Valkyrie.\nAffiliated with Loki Familia.</description>\n<picture>167872.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"34449\" picture=\"10864.jpeg\">Oonishi Saori</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"70851\" type=\"main character in\" update=\"2015-05-30\">\n<rating votes=\"318\">7.01</rating>\n<name>Hestia</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Affiliation: Hestia Familia chief god.</description>\n<picture>167871.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"21013\" picture=\"201781.jpg\">Minase Inori</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"70852\" type=\"main character in\" update=\"2015-05-30\">\n<rating votes=\"124\">5.11</rating>\n<name>Bell Cranel</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Title: Little Rookie.\nAffiliated with Hestia Familia.</description>\n<picture>167870.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"20249\" picture=\"186289.jpg\">Matsuoka Yoshitsugu</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"70853\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2017-06-24\">\n<rating votes=\"124\">6.01</rating>\n<name>Liliruca Arde</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Lili is a Pallum (race) Supporter, she was born to parents belonging to the Soma Familia, so at the moment of birth she was obliged to join.

However she was disgusted by the attitude of elves towards other races and left the village to reach Ontario a city full of opportunity. In the city she made friends with a female adventure that invited her to join Asteria familia, and also that she would call her Lyon since Lyu was to hard to say.\nLyu reached level 4 and specialised in using wind magic and sword fighting. She has a unique fighting technique that permits her to chant long spells while sword fighting. This style requires an enormous amount of concentration and Makoto even suggested that not even Aiz would be able to replicate such a feat. Her sword is made out of wood of a sacred tree.\nLater Lyon solo survived the destruction of Astrea Familia during an ambush by an enemy famila, she asked her familia goddess to leave Ontario for her protection, however this was only an excuse since she didn`t want her goddess to witnessing her revenge.\nShe took revenge by killing every member of the rival familia and anyone connected with them resulting in the guild offering a bounty on her head.\nAfter her revenge Lyon had no place to go, exhausted and injured was later saved by Syr, which asked her to join her in the staff of the Benevolent Mistress as a waitress. And changed back her name to Lyu.\nLyu sees Syr as her saviour and is totally dedicated in protecting her and helping her in her relationship with Bell.</description>\n<picture>170068.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"2296\" picture=\"189623.jpg\">Hayami Saori</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"73779\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2015-03-14\">\n<rating votes=\"61\">3.52</rating>\n<name>Loki</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>170066.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"28392\" picture=\"224735.jpg\">Kubo Yurika</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"75462\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2015-05-31\">\n<rating votes=\"37\">6.26</rating>\n<name>Welf Crozzo</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>He is a Level 2 Adventurer/Blacksmith currently affiliated with Hephaestus Familia.
