It was serialized in http://anidb.net/cr748 [Kodansha]`s Weekly Shonen Magazine from August 2006 to July 2017 with 63 volumes. In 2018 the sequel manga Fairy Tail 100 Years Quest was started.\nThe last year saw major changes for certain parties in Earth Land. First, fueled by the tragic death of his foster father http://anidb.net/ch22024 [Igneel] and the constant battles against the http://anidb.net/ch78540 [Dark Guild Tartaros], http://anidb.net/ch11801 [Natsu] left to travel the lands with http://anidb.net/ch11802 [Happy], a renewed determination to become even more powerful lighting his fire.\nEven more surprising was the disbandment of the http://anidb.net/ch18752 [Fairy Tail] guild, a command which came from Fairy Tail Master http://anidb.net/ch12248 [Makarov] himself without any explanation or prior notice. Much like Natsu and Happy, Makarov`s location was also kept secret.\nDuring that time, http://anidb.net/ch11720 [Lucy] landed a job as a reporter. Though she was committed to her work, she also decided to use her skills and resources to gather news of her friends as they moved about the continent. Working away with no real plan, Lucy thought her next big assignment at covering the annual Grand Magic Game would go off without a hitch... until Natsu and Happy make a grand appearance and reunite with her once again.\nNow, with the revival of Fairy Tail on their minds, Lucy, Natsu, and Happy set out on a new journey to find the rest of their friends and former guildmates to get things back to how they should be.\nSource: Tokyo Otaku Mode</description>\n<ratings>\n<permanent count=\"332\">6.18</permanent>\n<temporary count=\"341\">7.22</temporary>\n</ratings>\n<picture>224526.jpg</picture>\n<resources>\n<resource type=\"1\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>20846</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"2\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>35972</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"4\">\n<externalentity>\n<url>http://fairytail-tv.com/</url>\n</externalentity>\n<externalentity>\n<url>http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/fairytail/</url>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"6\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>Fairy_Tail</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"7\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>FAIRY_TAIL</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"8\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>5106</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"9\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>361353</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"10\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>11836</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"23\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>fairytail_PR</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"28\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>fairy-tail</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n</resources>\n<tags>\n<tag id=\"7\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2019-01-15\">\n<name>juujin</name>\n<description>Kemono, \"beast\", is a genre of Japanese art and character design that prominently features anthropomorphic animal characters. It is used widely in visual arts, especially drawing and painting, and can be found in many manga, anime, and video game.\nAnthropomorphic animal characters in the kemono genre are frequently called juujin, \"therianthrope\"; the kanji for juujin are also sometimes pronounced kemonobito, \"beast-human\". While their design differs from artist to artist, they generally employ animal traits considered cute and endearing; most kemono characters retain a fundamentally human personality, however, seldom behaving as the actual animals from which they have been anthropomorphized, and as such they are typically depicted living as humans do.\nJuujin leans more on the human-looking side when compared to http://anidb.net/t2857 [anthropomorphism], which leans more on the animal-looking side.\nSource: Manga Wikia</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"362\" parentid=\"2793\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2010-09-24\">\n<name>dancing</name>\n<description>Dance is when people move their body to music.

Humans, whose life span is limited and who die of age, disease and external trauma, have long sought ways to extend their lives; the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered one of the first great literary works created by mankind, is primarily the quest of a hero seeking to become immortal. The advances of science, in particular medicine and engineering, and especially in the last few centuries, have helped people extend their life span and may yet continue finding ways to do so.\nIn fiction, immortals are not quite as uncommon as in real life, and the possible implications of endless or very long lives are often explored. Such implications include, but are not limited to: repeatedly accompanying the deaths of those dear to them; having to hide their condition from the mortals surrounding them; becoming disillusioned with their lives and being unable to kill themselves; and even staying forever trapped in the body of a specific physical age, that body most often being that of a child. As such, while many may wish for immortality, it may be little more than a curse for the few who have it.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1471\" parentid=\"2653\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2011-01-19\">\n<name>bad cooking</name>\n<description>The character is hopelessly terrible at cooking, and any attempts he or she makes at making even the simplest dishes are spectacular failures.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2094\" parentid=\"2849\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2015-10-25\">\n<name>magic</name>\n<description>Magic is the art of purportedly manipulating aspects of reality either by supernatural means or through knowledge of unknown occult laws.</description>\n<picurl>178878.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2282\" parentid=\"2841\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-18\">\n<name>martial arts</name>\n<description>Various sports or skills, mainly of Japanese origin, that originated as forms of self-defense or attack, such as judo, karate, and kendo.</description>\n<picurl>210947.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2355\" parentid=\"2849\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-05-28\">\n<name>dragon</name>\n<description>Very intelligent mythical beings - a cross between a very large lizard and a dinosaur - that breath fire, and have a knack for kidnapping damsels, thus distressing them.

Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-28\">\n<name>dynamic</name>\n<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: \nPlot Continuity \nHow does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2606\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-05\">\n<name>target audience</name>\n<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-04-29\">\n<name>themes</name>\n<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2609\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-01\">\n<name>original work</name>\n<description>What the anime is based on!

More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.\nHaving a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.\nIt does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.\nA standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.\n[Source: TV Tropes]</description>\n<picurl>144260.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2618\" parentid=\"2841\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-10-07\">\n<name>collateral damage</name>\n<description>The usually action orientated anime does not only show large amounts of combat and weapon use, but also the incidental massive destruction of property, often due to the inability of the protagonists to aim properly.\nExample: Mecha duking it out in a densely populated urban area.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2619\" parentid=\"2841\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-26\">\n<name>gunfights</name>\n<description>Fights where two or more parties are firing guns at one another.</description>\n<picurl>211280.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2622\" parentid=\"2841\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-26\">\n<name>swordplay</name>\n<description>The act or art of using a sword or similar weapon skillfully.</description>\n<picurl>211286.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2623\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-01-21\">\n<name>super power</name>\n<description>Be it an ancient Greek Heracles, a cybernetic muscle-man, or a fourteen year-old girl in a mini-skirted sailor suit.

This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.\nA world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a \"more than cursory\" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.\nThe fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.\nA fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2637\" parentid=\"7050\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>time travel</name>\n<description>In time travel anime characters are transported through time either figuratively or literally to find themselves either in the past or the future</description>\n<picurl>210068.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2646\" parentid=\"2849\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-24\">\n<name>demon</name>\n<description>In Western lore, demons are often described as minions from Hell, generally known to attack humans and feast on their flesh or possess the bodies of those with weak souls.

That may be done to prompt sexual arousal, but many forms of exhibitionism actually mean to create humour or disparagement through shock value or mockery. The idea of exhibitionism is closely tied to the notions of decency and modesty in dressing, and as such is highly dependent on one`s own cultural background. Certain forms of exhibitionism may be considered indecent exposure, and thus in many jurisdictions they may lead to civil or criminal charges. While both deal with the lack of clothing and may in certain cases overlap, exhibitionism is very different from and not to be confused with http://anidb.net/t2304 [nudism].</description>\n<picurl>162657.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2749\" parentid=\"2604\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-08\">\n<name>nudity</name>\n<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.\nPeople, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.\nThough the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.\nNudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.\nEspecially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.\nSource: wiki</description>\n<picurl>60576.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2750\" parentid=\"2604\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-08\">\n<name>violence</name>\n<description>Violence is the use of physical force against oneself or another entity, compelling action against one`s will on pain of being hurt.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2773\" parentid=\"2094\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2015-01-18\">\n<name>magic circles</name>\n<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.\nTraditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.\nGenerally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.\nSource: wiki</description>\n<picurl>32800.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2774\" parentid=\"2094\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-10-08\">\n<name>spellcasting</name>\n<description>The magic version of “call your attacks”.

Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).\nIn popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture\nSource: Wiki</description>\n<picurl>68768.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2850\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2015-10-25\">\n<name>adventure</name>\n<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, \"jungle\" and \"desert\" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>\n<picurl>178879.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2853\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"500\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-02-13\">\n<name>comedy</name>\n<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results.

The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.\nMost henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2856\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-05\">\n<name>ecchi</name>\n<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes</description>\n<picurl>32416.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2857\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2019-01-15\">\n<name>anthropomorphism</name>\n<description>Anthropomorphism is the attribution of uniquely human characteristics to non-human beings, inanimate objects, or natural or supernatural phenomena.

As such, it doesn`t really have a \"main\" or \"lead\" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).\n\n* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.\n* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.\n* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).\n\nPictured: http://anidb.net/a9043 [K (anime)]</description>\n<picurl>94914.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4308\" parentid=\"6242\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2016-03-26\">\n<name>delayed death</name>\n<description>The Final Battle has begun. The two opponents square off, and one of them hits the other with a series of mighty blows that would fell a mountain. But what`s this? Nothing seems to be happening! That`s when your opponent tells you that You Are Already Dead, right before your head explodes, your body separates in two, or you disintegrate into a fine mist. If you`re unlucky, only one of those happens. Sometimes, you may also discover that you were Made of Explodium.\nA common trope in martial arts series, this involves some form of Finishing Move that does not take effect immediately. When used with martial arts, it may involve Pressure Point attacks or some form of Ki Attacks. Assassins may use Universal Poison to achieve a similar effect. In video games, Damage Over Time abilities often have this effect.\nWhen used with swords there are a number of common variations, often shown with a Diagonal Cut. In sword duels, the two sides charge each other and attack. There will be a pause as the two pose, then one (or both) will fall down. Another one is for a Master Swordsman to perform a series of lightning-fast slashes, and then slowly and dramatically sheath their sword (with an audible *click*) before their attacks take effect.\nThis trope is not necessarily limited to martial arts, either. In more modern settings, gunshot wounds can often have this effect, since getting shot typically feels like getting punched hard and it is not uncommon for victims to take some time to realize it. This can be exploited for dramatic effect in war movies, where fatally wounded soldiers wander the battlefield before succumbing.\nSource: TVTropes</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4342\" parentid=\"2925\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-05-06\">\n<name>large-scale war</name>\n<description>When the whole world, or, at least, a big part of it, partakes in the hell that is war.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4394\" parentid=\"6233\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-21\">\n<name>defeat means friendship</name>\n<description>In a series based around an endless series of one-on-one fights, defeating a Worthy Opponent or The Rival will sometimes convert them to the hero`s side, if not always to his cause. \nFurthermore, no matter how many people the Worthy Opponent has killed, how much grief he has caused, even if he slaughtered helpless children or the hero`s own family, as soon as he shows a bit of remorse or goes out of his way to help the hero even once, he will be welcomed into the hero`s circle of True Companions with open arms.\n(Source: TVTropes)</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4431\" parentid=\"2858\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-04-06\">\n<name>love at first sight</name>\n<description>Plot device: When two characters meet for the first time, at least one party, supposedly, immediately falls in love with the other party, and from then on tries to get to know that party better.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4537\" parentid=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-02-15\">\n<name>time skip</name>\n<description>The plot features at least one skip or jump in time.\nExample: A skip from the present into the past, or time skips in increments, e.g. every hour there is a time skip by a day.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4558\" parentid=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-02-12\">\n<name>long time span</name>\n<description>The anime spans a much longer than usual (for that genre) period of time, typically several years (possibly decades or even centuries).\nExample: In a school setting this could mean the character development is followed from school through college right into working life and the founding of a family with children.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4572\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2013-09-22\">\n<name>human-animal relationship</name>\n<description>The relationship between a human and an animal (or an animal-like creature like a dragon) plays an important role in the plot of this anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4584\" parentid=\"2637\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-03-13\">\n<name>time machine</name>\n<description>A machine (or sometimes a living being) that accomplishes time travel.

However, he is extremely loyal to his guildmates and attacks anyone who tries to harm or insult them.

Her member stamp was on her upper left shoulder.\nIt is also very possible that Lisanna, Elfman and Mirajane operated in a three man group similar to Shadow Gear. She lost her life while trying to revert Elfman after his full-body Take Over went awry. He quickly lost control of himself and went on a rampage. Lisana gave her life trying to calm him down and stop his rampage (actually she didnt die, but was transported to Edolas). How she actually was able to do this is unknown. The mental and emotional trauma that Elfman and Mirajane both experienced after Lisana`s supposed death crippled their powers considerably. Mirajane lost her S-class rank and has not fought since. Elfman suffered major emotional damage and was incapable to cast his full body takeover spell for some time. When he did try casting it, a flashback to Lisana caused him to lose concentration. When Lisanna was younger, she seemed to be very kind like Elfman and unlike Mirajane. She wanted to help Natsu Dragneel raise an unknown egg to see what comes out of it, being a little more knowledgable in it then Natsu. After seeing a softer side of the usually flamboyant Natsu, she stated that he was a lot like her sister and joked that perhaps later she should become his bride which predictably freaked him out. It is shown that while the Edolas version of Lisanna is deceased, the Eathland version of Lisanna is still alive. Like her Earth land counterpart, she seems just as friendly and caring, as seen when she scolds Lucy for bullying Natsu and tells Jet and Droy not to pick on Elfman. When Natsu and Happy see her they both shed tears and tried to hug her in joy, this freaked her out. She doesn`t seem to have the massive crush her Earth Realm counterpart has on Natsu.</description>\n<picture>78974.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"1918\" picture=\"225099.jpg\">Sakurai Harumi</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"17609\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2019-04-29\">\n<rating votes=\"40\">7.39</rating>\n<name>Ultear Milkovich</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Ultear is introduced as a member of the Magic Council who apparently works for Siegrain.

In addition, her body seems to be formed from the rain that surrounds her, leaving her intact and able to reform herself after attacks. Her nickname is also Juvia of the Sea, which correlates with her water controlling magic. When angry she can also control hot water. Juvia also often refers to herself in the 3rd person. Juvia has developed a crush on Gray, and due to a misunderstanding, views Lucy as her rival in love. After being defeated by Gray, the rain above her finally clears up which she thought was beautiful.\nAfter the fight, her deep infatuation with Gray continues, secretly following him wherever he goes. In the current arc, she mentions to Gray that she is now an independent mage once more, but Gray notes that she has probably has her eyes set on Fairy Tail. She is quite willing to do anything for him.\nShe is one of the few Phantom members to be shown after the Phantom Guild arc. The Spanish word \"lluvia\", which is pronounced like her name, means rain.</description>\n<picture>150495.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"6\" picture=\"171987.jpg\">Nakahara Mai</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"17632\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2013-04-11\">\n<rating votes=\"19\">4.31</rating>\n<name>Lyon Vastia</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Lyon Vastia, first introduced as Reitei Lyon, is one of three ice mages shown in the series, as well as a rival of Gray Fullbuster.
