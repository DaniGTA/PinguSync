So many of them were simply cut short, as would happen with real life in this era. The simple raw results of simple actions is what this series portrays.\n\nSome characters received way more attention than I thought they would and others far less. This definitely makes the series seem like it isn`t focused on one particular character, but more their interactions and the results of their actions upon this world.\n\nIt`s gruesome.

Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences.

As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2607","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2009-04-29"},"name":{"_text":"themes"},"description":{"_text":"Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories.

The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations.

Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.\nThough the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.\nNudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.\nEspecially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.\nSource: wiki"},"picurl":{"_text":"60576.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2750","parentid":"2604","infobox":"true","weight":"500","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2018-11-08"},"name":{"_text":"violence"},"description":{"_text":"Violence is the use of physical force against oneself or another entity, compelling action against one`s will on pain of being hurt.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2772","parentid":"36","infobox":"true","weight":"600","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2016-09-04"},"name":{"_text":"feudal warfare"},"description":{"_text":"Feudal Warfare is the warfare of the Middle Ages and therefore the setting must take place in a time line similar to that of Middle Ages or its Asian/American counterparts, or in a fantasy world.
