The MC is OP, but only because he`s able to calmly assess the situation and figure out the enemy`s weaknesses. So even against god-like powers, he always wins, and that`s how the group survives.\n\nThat doesn`t sound incredibly exciting, so why is it a must? Because it smashes your every expectative. The plot goes in a predictable way just to trick you, and then punches you with a mind-blowing twist that you should have seen coming, but did not. That happens every episode. In that aspect, it`s a lot like Code Geass or Death Note, and I don`t say this lightly (I love those two)."},{"_attributes":{"type":"Must See","uid":"288423"},"_text":"masterpiece shoud be at least 24 episode per season"},{"_attributes":{"type":"Must See","uid":"301049"},"_text":"Just finished episode 7.

Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2607","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2009-04-29"},"name":{"_text":"themes"},"description":{"_text":"Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories.
