In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret life as a half-ghoul/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":100,"titles":{"en":"Tokyo Ghoul","en_jp":"Tokyo Ghoul","en_us":"Tokyo Ghoul","ja_jp":"東京喰種-トーキョーグール-"},"canonicalTitle":"Tokyo Ghoul","abbreviatedTitles":["Tokyo Kushu","Toukyou Kushu","Toukyou Ghoul"],"averageRating":"80.76","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"470","3":"10","4":"389","5":"10","6":"539","7":"43","8":"2394","9":"65","10":"1836","11":"93","12":"3903","13":"219","14":"11040","15":"515","16":"10021","17":"594","18":"7281","19":"308","20":"20193"},"userCount":100128,"favoritesCount":3243,"startDate":"2014-07-04","endDate":"2014-09-19","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":27,"ratingRank":475,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"17+ (violence & profanity)","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8271/tiny.jpg?1416240363","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8271/small.jpg?1416240363","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8271/medium.jpg?1416240363","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8271/large.jpg?1416240363","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8271/original.jpg?1416240363","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8271/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8271/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8271/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8271/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":12,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":288,"youtubeVideoId":"vGuQeQsoRgU","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":12}}},{"subProviders":[{"providerLocalData":{"version":1,"infoStatus":3,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2020-03-07T20:10:53.425Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","isNSFW":false,"genres":[],"detailEpisodeInfo":[],"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"alternativeIds":[],"names":[],"overviews":[],"id":"11268","instanceName":"InfoProviderLocalData"}},{"providerLocalData":{"version":1,"infoStatus":3,"provider":"AniList","lastUpdate":"2020-03-07T20:10:53.425Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","isNSFW":false,"genres":[],"detailEpisodeInfo":[],"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"alternativeIds":[],"names":[],"overviews":[],"id":"21132","instanceName":"ListProviderLocalData","canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""}},{"providerLocalData":{"version":1,"infoStatus":3,"provider":"Mal","lastUpdate":"2020-03-07T20:10:53.425Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","isNSFW":false,"genres":[],"detailEpisodeInfo":[],"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"alternativeIds":[],"names":[],"overviews":[],"id":"30458","instanceName":"ListProviderLocalData","canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""}}],"mainProvider":{"providerLocalData":{"version":1,"infoStatus":2,"provider":"Kitsu","lastUpdate":"2020-03-07T20:10:53.424Z","lastExternalChange":"2020-03-07T18:00:14.534Z","covers":[{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10789/original.png?1445190456","size":1},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10789/tiny.jpg?1445190456","size":5},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10789/small.jpg?1445190456","size":4},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10789/large.jpg?1445190456","size":2}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"SPECIAL","isNSFW":false,"genres":[],"detailEpisodeInfo":[],"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"alternativeIds":[],"names":[{"name":"東京喰種 トーキョーグール【JACK】","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"tokyo-ghoul-jack","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"},{"name":"Tokyo Ghoul: \"Jack\"","lang":"canonicalTitle","nameType":"unkown"}],"overviews":[{"content":"Who needs school, who needs baseball, and who needs friends?

a powerful technique used by the Japanese during the second World War in order for them to gain the upper hand and establish their nation as a formidable force. But Japan was quickly defeated after the revered onmyouji Yakou Tsuchimikado caused the \"Great Spiritual Disaster,\" an event which plagues Tokyo to this very day. As a result of this mishap, the Onmyou Agency was established in order to exorcise further spiritual disasters and combat the demons that would make their way into the world.\r\nNow, Onmyoudou has become far more modern, simplified, and refined for use in a wide variety of applications such as medicine and technology.

But Japan was quickly defeated after the revered onmyouji Yakou Tsuchimikado caused the \"Great Spiritual Disaster,\" an event which plagues Tokyo to this very day. As a result of this mishap, the Onmyou Agency was established in order to exorcise further spiritual disasters and combat the demons that would make their way into the world.\r\nNow, Onmyoudou has become far more modern, simplified, and refined for use in a wide variety of applications such as medicine and technology. However, not everyone is able to utilize the magic, as is the case with Harutora, a member of the Tsuchimikado's branch family. Despite an old promise to protect Natsume, the heir of the Tsuchimikado's main family and Yakou's supposed reincarnation, as her familiar, Harutora has no talent and chooses to live a normal life instead. But when a prominent member of the Onmyou Agency attempts to recreate the same experiment which led to Japan's downfall, he decides to make good on his word and fight by Natsume's side.\r\n[Written by

school, quiet Tatsuma Hiyuu transfers to Magami Academy in Shinjuku. The mysterious boy's \"outsider\" status and his profound skills in martial arts quickly earn him the friendship of class delinquent Kyouichi Houraiji. Through an uncanny connection and a happenstance challenge, he also meets Yuuya Daigo of the wrestling club, the captain of the girls' archery club, Komaki Sakurai, and Aoi Misato, the Student Council President.\r\n\r\nDuring their encounter, there is a sudden, harsh disruption of the Ryumyaku (literally Dragon Pulse, otherwise known as Dragon Vein or Dragon Stream), the flow of arcane energy. The surge awakens within the five teenagers a latent power, giving them each a supernatural ability. Enlightened to their newly acquired gifts by Hisui, the young heir of the Kisaragi Clan who maintains his family's antiques shop - as well as their duty to protect Tokyo from Oni (demons) - the Magami students decide to use their power to protect the city from the onslaught of dark forces.\r\n\r\nBattling the demons alongside Hisui Kisaragi, the five unlikely friends discover that they may have to face a greater threat to Tokyo other than destroying a few malevolent, random monsters. The Ryumyaku had been disrupted by force, from someone invoking the Dark Arts - and that person has a wicked desire to unleash a long-dead evil.\r\n\r\nCan the teenagers overcome their own fears and flaws to fight against the Dark Arts? And soon they will also have to face their own destinies as they discover their Stars of Fate.\r\n\r\nThis anime is based on a manga, which was based on the Nintendo role-playing video game originally released in 1998.","lang":"eng"}],"id":"1677","instanceName":"ListProviderLocalData","canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":"","releaseYear":2007,"runTime":24,"publicScore":3287,"rawEntry":{"id":"1677","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1677"},"mappings":[{"id":"58083","type":"mappings","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/58083"},"relationships":{"item":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/58083/relationships/item","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/58083/item"}}},"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"externalSite":"anidb","externalId":"4799"},{"id":"72419","type":"mappings","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72419"},"relationships":{"item":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72419/relationships/item","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72419/item"}}},"createdAt":"2018-01-24T03:57:24.261Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T03:57:24.261Z","externalSite":"anilist","externalId":"anime/1860"},{"id":"72417","type":"mappings","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72417"},"relationships":{"item":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72417/relationships/item","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72417/item"}}},"createdAt":"2018-01-24T03:57:24.219Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T03:57:24.219Z","externalSite":"aozora","externalId":"jG3Tfxx8j6"},{"id":"67300","type":"mappings","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/67300"},"relationships":{"item":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/67300/relationships/item","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/67300/item"}}},"createdAt":"2017-11-23T10:00:59.852Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-23T10:00:59.852Z","externalSite":"hulu","externalId":"50000805"},{"id":"4727","type":"mappings","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/4727"},"relationships":{"item":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/4727/relationships/item","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/4727/item"}}},"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"externalSite":"myanimelist/anime","externalId":"1860"},{"id":"72420","type":"mappings","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72420"},"relationships":{"item":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72420/relationships/item","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72420/item"}}},"createdAt":"2018-01-24T03:57:24.276Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T03:57:24.276Z","externalSite":"thetvdb","externalId":"80014"},{"id":"72418","type":"mappings","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72418"},"relationships":{"item":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72418/relationships/item","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/mappings/72418/item"}}},"createdAt":"2018-01-24T03:57:24.247Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T03:57:24.247Z","externalSite":"trakt","externalId":"34577"}],"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:26:40.253Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-07T18:00:14.534Z","slug":"tokyo-majin-gakuen-kenpucho-tou","synopsis":"Something evil is stirring in the shadows of Tokyo...\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of his senior year in high school, quiet Tatsuma Hiyuu transfers to Magami Academy in Shinjuku. The mysterious boy's \"outsider\" status and his profound skills in martial arts quickly earn him the friendship of class delinquent Kyouichi Houraiji. Through an uncanny connection and a happenstance challenge, he also meets Yuuya Daigo of the wrestling club, the captain of the girls' archery club, Komaki Sakurai, and Aoi Misato, the Student Council President.\r\n\r\nDuring their encounter, there is a sudden, harsh disruption of the Ryumyaku (literally Dragon Pulse, otherwise known as Dragon Vein or Dragon Stream), the flow of arcane energy. The surge awakens within the five teenagers a latent power, giving them each a supernatural ability. Enlightened to their newly acquired gifts by Hisui, the young heir of the Kisaragi Clan who maintains his family's antiques shop - as well as their duty to protect Tokyo from Oni (demons) - the Magami students decide to use their power to protect the city from the onslaught of dark forces.\r\n\r\nBattling the demons alongside Hisui Kisaragi, the five unlikely friends discover that they may have to face a greater threat to Tokyo other than destroying a few malevolent, random monsters.
