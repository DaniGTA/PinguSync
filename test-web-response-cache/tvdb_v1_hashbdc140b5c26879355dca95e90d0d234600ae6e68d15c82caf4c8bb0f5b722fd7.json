The surviving races now make their homes up on floating islands in the sky, out of reach of all but the most mobile of Beasts.\r\n\r\nOnly a small group of young girls, the Fairies, can wield the ancient weapons needed to fend off invasions from these creatures. Into the girlsâ€™ unstable and fleeting lives, where a call to certain death could come at any moment, enters an unlikely character: a young man who lost everything in his final battle five hundred years ago, the last living human awakened from a long, icy slumber.","lastUpdated":1579257718,"airsDayOfWeek":"Tuesday","airsTime":"11:30 PM","rating":"TV-14","imdbId":"tt6819736","zap2itId":"","added":"2017-03-09 10:03:04","addedBy":120974,"siteRating":9.5,"siteRatingCount":215,"slug":"worldend-what-do-you-do-at-the-end-of-the-world-are-you-busy-will-you-save-us"}},"releaseYear":2017}}}}
