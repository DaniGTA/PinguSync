While the handkerchief is precious to her and she appreciates his returning it she is angry that he has seen her in such a state and challenges him to a duel. He proves to be remarkably skilled, and he saves her when they are mysteriously attacked from an unexpected quarter. The student council president Claudia Enfield puts a stop to the duel, saying it is invalid because Ayato has not yet completed all the paperwork for his transfer.\nHe learns from Claudia a bit about the Academy and about his opponent, Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld who is a princess from a small European country. He also asks about his elder sister, Amagiri Haruka, who mysteriously disappeared but seems to have garbled records in the Academy. He attends class and finds that Julis is also in the same class and she expresses her dislike for him, but he is befriended by his classmate Yabuki Eishirou.

Eishirou leaves suddenly for an errand so Ayato asks Julis how to get to the boys` dormitories, and asks her to show her around campus the following day as a favour. She agrees reluctantly remembering how he had saved her life.\nThe next day Ayato sees an that an old friend, Sasamiya Saya, is also in his class. She too offers to show him around campus, and Claudia briefly comes by to give him the forms needed to apply for use of a weapon. He settles the dispute between Saya and Julis by saying they can both show him around. Saya it turns out is almost as ignorant of the campus as Ayato, and when the tour is done, he goes off to buy them drinks. Julis is about to challenge Saya to a duel after Saya says that Julis is nowhere near as strong as Ayato, but before they can start they are attacked by the mysterious assassins who interfered with Julis`s duel with Ayato the day before. The assassins are driven off but no trace of them is found by campus security.\nAyato goes to the weapon compatibility test and sees that Lester is also trying to apply, and he too wants to take the sword Ser Veresta, just as Ayato does. Lester tests himself against it but gets a low compatibility score, that only gets lower as he attempts to dominate it, until his score becomes negative and it attacks.

Claudia thus asks Ayato to watch over Julis and help protect her.\nThe next day Ayato has sort of a date with Julis who shows him around the city. While they are having lunch Lester shows up and tries to challenge Julis yet again, and Ayato points out that his behaviour towards her has made him a suspect, which makes him very angry, but his flunkies manage to calm him down. On their way back they see a group of punks seemingly having a brawl at a park, but this is a ruse that allows them to surround Julis and Ayato, but they make short work of the punks. One punk explains how someone had hired them to rough them up a little, and he sees the man who hired them in the trees. Julis chases after him, with Ayato right behind, but there are several attackers and they manage to damage Ayato`s clothes before escaping.\nWhen they return to the dorms Julis mends Ayato`s clothes and explains how despite being a princess she befriended the children in an orphanage in her country, and how she is fighting in Asterisk to obtain the money which they badly need and how the handkerchief Ayato recovered was a keepsake of theirs.\nThe following day Julis receives a letter which makes her leave school without explanation before anyone can stop her.

Now, the plot was just average. The protagonist meets a girl and then builds a harem, and there`s some conflict regarding the past, but it really goes nowhere.

In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies).

When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes"},"picurl":{"_text":"32416.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2858","parentid":"2611","weight":"200","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2017-12-01"},"name":{"_text":"romance"},"description":{"_text":"Romance describes a story that deals with love between two or more characters typically also having an optimistic ending.

Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a \"http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]\", or sometimes also \"male harem\". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.\nAs a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.\nMost of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called \"harem ending\"."},"picurl":{"_text":"94602.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"3040","parentid":"6230","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2018-11-01"},"name":{"_text":"male protagonist"},"description":{"_text":"This anime has a male protagonist."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"3759","parentid":"2607","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2010-04-11"},"name":{"_text":"teamwork"},"description":{"_text":"A cooperative effort by the members of a group or team to achieve a common goal."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"3863","parentid":"2611","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2008-07-05"},"name":{"_text":"competition"},"description":{"_text":"Some sort of confrontation occurs in this show.

Lester arrives, and confronts Silas, who attacks, sending his puppets to do his fighting for him. He has a large number of powerful puppets and Lester is badly beaten, and Julis is injured as she realises that only Allekant has the technological ability to make such puppets.\nAyato arrives just in time and by using Ser Veresta he manages to destroy the puppets permanently, and realises that Silas`s strategy involves using his puppets like chess pieces. In that way he manages to destroy all the puppets and defeat Silas. Just as he has finished chains materialise and lock about him and he realises that his sister had done something that sealed away part of his power so he can only use it at its fullest for at most five minutes.\nLater, Silas has come to after his defeat and is confronted by Claudia, who injures him badly so he can be interrogated.

Claudia thus asks Ayato to watch over Julis and help protect her.\nThe next day Ayato has sort of a date with Julis who shows him around the city. While they are having lunch Lester shows up and tries to challenge Julis yet again, and Ayato points out that his behaviour towards her has made him a suspect, which makes him very angry, but his flunkies manage to calm him down. On their way back they see a group of punks seemingly having a brawl at a park, but this is a ruse that allows them to surround Julis and Ayato, but they make short work of the punks. One punk explains how someone had hired them to rough them up a little, and he sees the man who hired them in the trees. Julis chases after him, with Ayato right behind, but there are several attackers and they manage to damage Ayato`s clothes before escaping.\nWhen they return to the dorms Julis mends Ayato`s clothes and explains how despite being a princess she befriended the children in an orphanage in her country, and how she is fighting in Asterisk to obtain the money which they badly need and how the handkerchief Ayato recovered was a keepsake of theirs.\nThe following day Julis receives a letter which makes her leave school without explanation before anyone can stop her.

She agrees reluctantly remembering how he had saved her life.\nThe next day Ayato sees an that an old friend, Sasamiya Saya, is also in his class. She too offers to show him around campus, and Claudia briefly comes by to give him the forms needed to apply for use of a weapon. He settles the dispute between Saya and Julis by saying they can both show him around. Saya it turns out is almost as ignorant of the campus as Ayato, and when the tour is done, he goes off to buy them drinks. Julis is about to challenge Saya to a duel after Saya says that Julis is nowhere near as strong as Ayato, but before they can start they are attacked by the mysterious assassins who interfered with Julis`s duel with Ayato the day before. The assassins are driven off but no trace of them is found by campus security.\nAyato goes to the weapon compatibility test and sees that Lester is also trying to apply, and he too wants to take the sword Ser Veresta, just as Ayato does.
