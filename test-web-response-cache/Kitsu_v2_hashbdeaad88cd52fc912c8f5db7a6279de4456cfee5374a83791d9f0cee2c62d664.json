The dragon, named Tohru, has the ability to magically transform into an adorable human girl (albeit with horns and a long tail!), who will do anything to pay off her debt of gratitude, whether Miss Kobayashi likes it or not. With a very persistent and amorous dragon as a roommate, nothing comes easy, and Miss Kobayashi’s normal life is about to go off the deep end!\r\n\r\n(Source: Crunchyroll)","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid","en_jp":"Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon","ja_jp":"小林さんちのメイドラゴン"},"canonicalTitle":"Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon","abbreviatedTitles":["The maid dragon of Kobayashi-san"],"averageRating":"82.59","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"310","3":"3","4":"58","5":"14","6":"69","7":"10","8":"608","9":"22","10":"404","11":"50","12":"973","13":"145","14":"5037","15":"505","16":"5590","17":"696","18":"4073","19":"314","20":"8447"},"userCount":47148,"favoritesCount":846,"startDate":"2017-01-12","endDate":"2017-04-06","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":124,"ratingRank":100,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12243/tiny.jpg?1489935891","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12243/small.jpg?1489935891","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12243/medium.jpg?1489935891","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12243/large.jpg?1489935891","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12243/original.jpg?1489935891","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/12243/tiny.jpg?1519183036","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/12243/small.jpg?1519183036","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/12243/large.jpg?1519183036","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/12243/original.jpg?1519183036","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":13,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":312,"youtubeVideoId":"8JME_Pa8rgY","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":13}}}}
