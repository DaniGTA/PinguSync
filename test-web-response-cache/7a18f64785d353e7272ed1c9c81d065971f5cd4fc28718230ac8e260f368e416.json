He named her Shana.<br><br>\\nNot long after he enters high school, Sakai Yuji&rsquo;s normal days come to an end. He sees something bizarre on his way home: people are frozen in a strange fire, and a monster that looks like a large doll is attacking them. Just when he's about to be killed, a girl in a dark cloak wielding a large sword appears, and slices the monster in half. Although Yuji survives the strange encounter, the girl informs him of a desolate truth: \\\" 'You' don't exist anymore.\\\"<br><br>\\nShe calls herself a Flame Haze who hunts \\\"Guze no Tomogara\\\"; intruders from another world. She explains to him that he is a \\\"Torch\\\", a substitute of Yuji whose &ldquo;existence&rdquo; has already been devoured. She also told him that he is a special Torch, \\\"Mystes\\\", which contains a precious item in it. When he looks at his chest, he sees within himself a faint flame, just as she said.<br><br>\\nIt is in this way that his eternal struggle alongside the girl begins. <br><br>\\n(Source: AnimeNfo) \",\"averageScore\":72,\"meanScore\":72,\"genres\":[\"Action\",\"Comedy\",\"Drama\",\"Fantasy\",\"Romance\"],\"synonyms\":[\"Shana of the Burning Eyes\"],\"nextAiringEpisode\":null,\"relations\":{\"edges\":[{\"relationType\":\"SEQUEL\"},{\"relationType\":\"ADAPTATION\"},{\"relationType\":\"SIDE_STORY\"},{\"relationType\":\"SIDE_STORY\"},{\"relationType\":\"CHARACTER\"},{\"relationType\":\"SIDE_STORY\"},{\"relationType\":\"ALTERNATIVE\"}],\"nodes\":[{\"id\":2787},{\"id\":33074},{\"id\":1531},{\"id\":6330},{\"id\":6628},{\"id\":1066},{\"id\":1815}]}}}}","headers":{},"request":{"uri":{"protocol":"https:","slashes":true,"auth":null,"host":"graphql.anilist.co","port":443,"hostname":"graphql.anilist.co","hash":null,"search":null,"query":null,"pathname":"/","path":"/","href":"https://graphql.anilist.co/"},"method":"POST","headers":{}}}
