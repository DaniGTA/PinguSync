I found that i oreffered slapstick and made sure to at least give those a chance before writing them of. This series is the epitome of slapstick. Never have i seen a more perfect series for frankly any anime lover. This series is one of my great loves when it domes to anime (only possibly matched by FMP:Fumoffu!) and deserves your free time.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"536175\">The best long-running series EVER!!</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"398315\">One of the great comedy animes and perhaps the greatest parody comedy. Even if you generally dislike shounen (as I do), don`t let that label deter you -- the shounen atmosphere is only a backdrop for parody that ranges across all types of Japanese TV, film and culture. Ignore the outrageous negative hype -- this show is *not* just an endless series of mindless references to Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, etc. With that said, the show isn`t without its flaws, most notably the shift in emphasis from comedy to action in the later eps and occasional overuse of toilet humor throughout the series. But it`s still a \"must-watch\" anime.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"497690\">I wont go on and tell u that this anime is great or not, you have to decide it for yourself. But I just want to tell that this show is like cocaine/weed, it is seriously ADDICTIVE, totally non-resistible once you like it. I considered myself Gintama`s biggest hooligan, not fan. Every episode I watched 3 times, some 10. I remember all the jokes. My point is that this series is seriously ADDICTIVE and it change you and your habit of watching anime completely. Before this I watched anime casually. After this I watch only the best the world has to offer, and mostly that consists of re-watching Gintama. Say goodbye to sissy moeblob shit if u decided to watch this, because afterwards, the whole anime landscape with you is filled with mostly shit. You become easily unsatisfied with anime. And before you know it, you will have a big gap in your heart waiting for the new episode of Gintama every week.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"13780\">To much fun to watch...\nYour Heart will not endure this anime!\nFunny parts, lots of crazy fights!</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"373896\">A genius comedy.

There is a huge gap between all seasons of Gintama and other anime in my top. Godlike comedy/parody, great action and the balance between these two couldn`t be any better. Free storyline and unparalleled characters create such awesome situations. While watching, I often felt like the author sees inside my head and is projecting my wishes into the anime.

Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2606\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-05\">\n<name>target audience</name>\n<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-04-29\">\n<name>themes</name>\n<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2608\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-12-04\">\n<name>fetishes</name>\n<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2609\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-01\">\n<name>original work</name>\n<description>What the anime is based on!

This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.\nA world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a \"more than cursory\" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.\nThe fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.\nA fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2630\" parentid=\"2613\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-10-13\">\n<name>Earth</name>\n<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>\n<picurl>126792.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2638\" parentid=\"2846\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2005-05-07\">\n<name>mecha</name>\n<description>Mecha in Japanese basically means mechanical things; everything from an electric whisk or a car to a spaceship or a robot.

The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The \"fourth wall\" is the imaginary \"wall\" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2655\" parentid=\"2853\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2005-05-09\">\n<name>parody</name>\n<description>Anime that imitate other stories (can be from TV, film, books, historical events, ...) for comic effect by exaggerating the style and changing the content of the original.

Bakumatsu represents the final years of the Edo period (when the Tokugawa shogunate ended) and preceded the Meiji era. The primary historical significance of Bakumatsu was the conflict between the pro-imperialist \"Ishin Shishi\" (\"nationalist patriots\"), and the shogunate forces, including the elite Shinsengumi (\"New Selected Corps\").\nThe Meiji Era (including Meiji Restoration) denotes the 45-year reign of Emperor Meiji, running from 23 October 1868 to 30 July 1912.

When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes</description>\n<picurl>32416.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2858\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>romance</name>\n<description>Romance describes a story that deals with love between two or more characters typically also having an optimistic ending.

Like anime, they generally air in three-month seasons or multiples thereof, with new shows airing every season. Some kinds of drama, especially the morning or afternoon ones, tend to be broadcast daily, while evening ones tend to be broadcast weekly, also like anime.\nIn exceedingly rare instances, a specific episode of a new original work anime can also be adapted.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4522\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2021-04-12\">\n<name>social commentary</name>\n<description>Social commentary is the act of using rhetorical means to provide commentary on issues in a society. This is often done with the idea of implementing or promoting change by informing the general populace about a given problem and appealing to people`s sense of justice. Social commentary can be practiced through all forms of communication, from printed form, to conversations to computerized communication.\nSince this is anime, usually, the mores of Japan and the Japanese society are scrutinised, but not restricted to that.\nThis tag should only apply to anime where social commentary is major theme that is explored thoroughly as a main (sub-)plot element. As social commentary, the anime should send a message to the viewers, criticising our society through fiction; merely portraying complex social elements such as racism is not sufficient.\nExamples of anime that provide social commentary:\nhttp://anidb.net/a812 [Roujin Z]: criticism of our healthcare system for the elderly and our growing reliance on artificial intelligence in medicine.\nhttp://anidb.net/a191 [GTO (Great Teacher Onizuka)]: many episodes criticise our education system in schools, as well as the ethics and struggles of teaching, showing the negative effects of bullying in schools.\nhttp://anidb.net/a4121 [NHK ni Youkoso!]: criticises the Otaku culture.\nNon-examples:\nhttp://anidb.net/a10401 [Tokyo Ghoul]: depicts two different living species hating each other (a common trope in fiction, including anime) as an excuse for action and violence, as well as resolving conflicts between the two species that are irrelevant to our social issues.\nSource: Wikipedia</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4611\" parentid=\"6230\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-10-22\">\n<name>nearly almighty protagonist</name>\n<description>Man 1: \"Hey man, did you see me take down that guy over there, there`s no way he could have survived that!\"\nMan 2: \"Yeah I know what you mean, it would take the strength of 1 million men to be able to .....

The magazine was created by http://anidb.net/cr780 [Shueisha] in July, 1968, and was originally only called Shounen Jump, because it was not published every week at the time. A number of very famous shounen manga were or are published in it, such as http://anidb.net/a386 [Hokuto no Ken], http://anidb.net/a231 [Dragon Ball], http://anidb.net/a942 [City Hunter], http://anidb.net/a826 [Saint Seiya], http://anidb.net/a590 [Slam Dunk], http://anidb.net/a312 [Yuu Yuu Hakushou], http://anidb.net/a69 [One Piece], http://anidb.net/a239 [Naruto], http://anidb.net/a2369 [Bleach], http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], http://anidb.net/a3468 [Gintama], to name a few of the most well-known.</description>\n<picurl>66685.png</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"5876\" parentid=\"6149\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-08-25\">\n<name>biting</name>\n<description>Some people seem to like biting others, especially when irritated.

Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.\nIn some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to \"finish\", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.\nAn incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"6017\" parentid=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-11-03\">\n<name>perpetual ongoing</name>\n<description>No end in sight!\nNo matter what the genre may be or what the storyline consists of, this series just keeps on going... and on... and on.\nThe obvious downside to this is the lack of story-related focus, usually some vague goal is simply never reached.

Yakuza\" and breaks down weeping during \"My Neighbor Pedoro.\" He also seems to care for Okita`s sister and is willing to sacrifice his life to protect her. These feelings, however, are usually kept bottled up and kept behind a mask of nonchalance, because he believes that with the life of violence that he lives, he will not be able to provide happiness for her.</description>\n<picture>29349.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"259\" picture=\"17082.jpg\">Nakai Kazuya</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"1168\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2017-11-14\">\n<rating votes=\"335\">8.59</rating>\n<name>Okita Sougo</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Okita is the best swordsman in the Shinsengumi.

She often displays her trademark sweet-looking smile with her eyes closed before engaging in her violent activities. Her killer intent is so strong that on one occasion, a stare from her brings the entire Shinsengumi on their knees begging for mercy.

Ever since that incident, she has become infatuated with him, much to his exasperation. Her feelings for him seem to be encouraged, as she enjoys being put down and threatened by him, due to her extreme masochism. Her attacks are mostly based on natto and bondage. She often follows Gintoki and the rest of Yorozuya around much to his knowledge, throwing objects at her to come out when he needs her help. She cannot stand Zenzo Hattori, her former Oniwaban comrade, and has \"attacked\" him at his \"weak point\" (his haemorrhoids) by shoving in an enormous syringe, wooden barbecue stick and a candle.</description>\n<picture>16192.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"79\" picture=\"228519.jpg\">Kobayashi Yuu</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"1651\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2010-03-19\">\n<rating votes=\"35\">4.12</rating>\n<name>Terakado Tsuu</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>An idol pop singer whose song lyrics are often very dirty or controversial.

Now he is seen making machines and fixing Gintoki`s bike.</description>\n<picture>16220.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"28\" picture=\"23184.jpg\">Aono Takeshi</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"1708\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2012-01-26\">\n<rating votes=\"5\">1.83</rating>\n<name>Yagyuu Koshinori</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Yagyuu Koshinori is http://anidb.net/ch1667 [Kyubee]`s father.</description>\n<picture>80566.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"371\" picture=\"166173.jpg\">Kuroda Takaya</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"2069\" type=\"cameo appearance in\" update=\"2013-05-11\">\n<rating votes=\"1321\">6.37</rating>\n<name>Kurosaki Ichigo</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Kurosaki Ichigo was raised by his father together with his two sisters after the traumatic experience of losing his mother.

She enjoys making all manners of inventions (usually designed as pranks) and uses them frequently, often prompting some disastrous effect or another. Upon arriving on Earth, Lala pretends to love Rito to keep herself from getting married, but does exactly what she did not intend, after she misinterprets what Rito shouts in self-defence. Throughout the series, she always tries to get Rito to love her more, and barely shows any form of negativity towards him; she even states it is impossible for her to hate him.</description>\n<picture>61495.jpg</picture>\n</character>\n<character id=\"2475\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2009-01-16\">\n<rating votes=\"7\">3.97</rating>\n<name>Hasegawa Hatsu</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>The estranged wife of Hasegawa Taizo.</description>\n<picture>17761.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"2254\" picture=\"21837.jpg\">Kubo Sayuri</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"3540\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2012-08-16\">\n<rating votes=\"1\">7.75</rating>\n<name>Cherry Taisa</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>19307.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"335\" picture=\"64826.jpg\">Takagi Wataru</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"3542\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2012-08-16\">\n<name>Spacewoman</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>19310.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"1509\" picture=\"19311.jpg\">Fukami Rika</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"3974\" type=\"cameo appearance in\" update=\"2012-04-10\">\n<rating votes=\"335\">9.20</rating>\n<name>Char Aznable</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Known as the \"Red Comet\" for his high-speed attack tactics, Char is the most famous of Zeon`s ace mobile suit pilots.

He is also extremely calm, even in battle, and is very seldom surprised by even the most drastic of actions. Ironically, when he was younger, he was quick to anger and very hotheaded, as noted by his grandfather, http://anidb.net/ch9327 [Kuchiki Ginrei]; similar to the the way http://anidb.net/ch2069 [Ichigo] and http://anidb.net/ch8722 [Renji] are now.\nByakuya strongly believes in law and order.

He thinks that if someone in his position doesn`t follow the rules as a good example, then no one will follow them.

Despite his icy and regal manner, Byakuya cares for and protects those important to him, even referring to http://anidb.net/ch3720 [Rukia] as his \"pride\".\n[Source: wiki]</description>\n<picture>54978.jpg</picture>\n</character>\n<character id=\"7827\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2012-01-26\">\n<rating votes=\"127\">7.74</rating>\n<name>Tama</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>80557.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"186\" picture=\"16999.jpg\">Minami Omi</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"8701\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2012-05-27\">\n<rating votes=\"20\">6.41</rating>\n<name>Umibouzu</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Kagura and Kamui`s father and one of the last members of the Yato clan.

It`s also equipped with an advanced computer which learns from its pilot, ultimately enabling it to operate the Gundam automatically.

She took such great care of him that she neglected her own health and developed tuberculosis, and forfeited her own chance for marriage when she was of marriageable age. As a result, http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] respected her immensely, addressing her very respectfully as ane-ue (姉上) and using the formal courteous form boku (僕) to refer to himself when speaking to her. She in turn called http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] affectionately as sou-chan.\nMitsuba`s sickly condition deteriorated when she came to Edo to be with her husband-to-be http://anidb.net/ch12344 [Kuraba Touma], who unbeknown to her, was using her and http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] as pawns in order to `buy over` http://anidb.net/ch6221 [Shinsengumi] so as to allow his own illicit arms trade with http://anidb.net/ch6222 [Joui] extremists.\nSends http://anidb.net/ch6221 [Shinsengumi] tear-inducing extra-spicy senbei (flavoured rice crackers) every month.\nHer last words to http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] before she passed away in Episode 87 were `You are the brother that I am so proud of`.\nThough younger brother http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Okita Sougo] resembled her a lot superficially, character-wise they are exact opposite. Mitsuba is the archetypal virtuous female character, termed yamato nadeshiko (大和撫子) aka traditional feminine virtues of olden Japan, as well as the stereotype figure of bijin hakumei (美人薄命) aka the beautiful die young.\nLoves to add spice to all the food she eats, fanaticism on par with http://anidb.net/ch1167 [Hijikata] and his mayonnaise. Adds tabasco sauce to chocolate parfait. Expressed her wish to follow http://anidb.net/ch1167 [Hijikata Toushirou] to Edo when they were still in Bushuu (武州), but was rejected by him, out of concern for her safety and happiness. Although it is revealed that http://anidb.net/ch1167 [Hijikata] does in fact love her, he feels that he is unable to give her happiness, that is why he treats her coldly.</description>\n<picture>37333.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"508\" picture=\"140061.jpg\">Shimamoto Sumi</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"12346\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2013-02-03\">\n<name>Yabuta</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>131723.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"4742\" picture=\"54426.jpg\">Fukumatsu Shin`ya</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"12347\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2009-10-17\">\n<name>Nakayama</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>37335.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"2355\" picture=\"223496.jpg\">Tachibana Yuuko</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"12348\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2009-10-17\">\n<name>Sentou Yousei Shazzan</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>37336.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"372\" picture=\"141584.jpg\">Sugimoto Yuu</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"12364\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2013-02-10\">\n<rating votes=\"1\">1.17</rating>\n<name>Kumoderu Jiraia</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Jiraia the Spider (real name Danzou Tobita) was born in he country side to Iga Samurai, and had a talent for ninjutsu since he was a kid.

So big fights began, and the Tobitas were destroyed. Only Danzou and his sister survived, and in order to protect his sister, Danzou had to work under the people he hated. He became a war machine, and tried to escape reality by fighting. Her sister, knowing that she was the problem, threw herself from a cliff. Danzou could not forgive himself of being unable to protect his sister. So he burned his face and lived a life in solitude. He tried to kill the Shogun, but Hattori`s father stopped him. In the end, to stop his pain, he decided to get killed by someone who resembles him. So he raised a student, Tsukuyo, and taught her everything he knew. So Jiraia came back to Yoshiwara to take Tsukuyo. He defeated Gintoki, because he thought that he was one of Tsukuyo`s weakness. Then he burned the other Tsukuyo`s weakness, Yoshiwara. But thanks to Shinpachi, Kagura, Hattori and Hinowa, the fire was extinguished. Gintoki went to save Tsukuyo from Jiraia, and the fight began. Jiraia was defeated by Gintoki, but he was killed by Tsukuyo, like he wanted. He died looking at the moon, embracing Tsukuyo. He was the strongest man in the Oniwabanshu, and the one who created the Hyakka.
