Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.\nOn an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.\nSource: Wikipedia"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2672","parentid":"2834","weight":"100","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2018-03-05"},"name":{"_text":"Japan"},"description":{"_text":"Japan is a sovereign island nation in East Asia.
