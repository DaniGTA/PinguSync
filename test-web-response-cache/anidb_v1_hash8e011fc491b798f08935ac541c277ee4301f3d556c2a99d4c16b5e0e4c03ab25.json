Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.\nThere is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.\nIn anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen."},"picurl":{"_text":"149786.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2605","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2014-09-28"},"name":{"_text":"dynamic"},"description":{"_text":"Some of the central structural elements in anime are: \nPlot Continuity \nHow does the plot or several plots unfold.

Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2607","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2009-04-29"},"name":{"_text":"themes"},"description":{"_text":"Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories.

When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes"},"picurl":{"_text":"32416.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2857","parentid":"2611","weight":"200","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2019-01-15"},"name":{"_text":"anthropomorphism"},"description":{"_text":"Anthropomorphism is the attribution of uniquely human characteristics to non-human beings, inanimate objects, or natural or supernatural phenomena.

She lost her life while trying to revert Elfman after his full-body Take Over went awry. He quickly lost control of himself and went on a rampage. Lisana gave her life trying to calm him down and stop his rampage (actually she didnt die, but was transported to Edolas). How she actually was able to do this is unknown. The mental and emotional trauma that Elfman and Mirajane both experienced after Lisana`s supposed death crippled their powers considerably. Mirajane lost her S-class rank and has not fought since. Elfman suffered major emotional damage and was incapable to cast his full body takeover spell for some time. When he did try casting it, a flashback to Lisana caused him to lose concentration. When Lisanna was younger, she seemed to be very kind like Elfman and unlike Mirajane. She wanted to help Natsu Dragneel raise an unknown egg to see what comes out of it, being a little more knowledgable in it then Natsu. After seeing a softer side of the usually flamboyant Natsu, she stated that he was a lot like her sister and joked that perhaps later she should become his bride which predictably freaked him out. It is shown that while the Edolas version of Lisanna is deceased, the Eathland version of Lisanna is still alive. Like her Earth land counterpart, she seems just as friendly and caring, as seen when she scolds Lucy for bullying Natsu and tells Jet and Droy not to pick on Elfman. When Natsu and Happy see her they both shed tears and tried to hug her in joy, this freaked her out.
