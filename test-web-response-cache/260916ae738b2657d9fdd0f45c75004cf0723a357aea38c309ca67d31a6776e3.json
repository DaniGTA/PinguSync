This is far and away the best, in my humble opinion, romance, TRUE ROMANCE, anime out there. I`ll give you money to watch this - it`s that good. You`ll be left craving for more and you`ll definitely play the VN. I`d rate this a 9,5/10 - I`d slap a 10/10, but that implies perfection and nobody is perfect =P</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"169056\">Another best story from Visual Art/Key and  hi-quality animation work by KyoAni .</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"25011\">Full spectrum from drama to comedy - beautiful animation and op/ed theme</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"142175\">Very nice new romantic anime.

Lighthearted. Laughter. Tears. This anime has a fun and mellow feel to it, but surprisingly has the perfect, sad psychological touches that can really grab viewers. Also, the characters all seem to fit in their own way into the story. Clannad actually brings out different emotions from you, making it a great unique watch.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"194400\">it`s funy</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"363530\">A great heart felt story, guaranteed to move the soul.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"424296\">An anime about life. Sometimes funny sometimes extremely sad. \n\n*warning-moe blobs</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"452040\">Great story, voice acting, and memorable characters. this is so far the only anime that made me shed tears EVER.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"251684\">Depois de Kanon, este é obrigatório</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"246151\">I cryed lot with this serie same with Air. Then I saw Kanon and Angel Beats and realized that Key will never come with anything new and started little hesitate about their shows.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"554983\">Clannad is a quite funny though moving show. Some characters have a whole story arc revolving around them, as in many harem animes, but the harem component is quite secondary in this show, in my opinion. The storylines is from times to times a bit obvious, but still the show is entertaining and little by little you get to care for the main two characters.\n\nI only recommend this season, but the second season, Clannad ~ After Story, is definitely a must-see. It brings the show to a whole new level, tragic and moving.\nOf course you should watch the first season before After Story.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"328481\">if you love romance with harem...you`re looking at the right page</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"780947\">Make sure you get the side stories. As someone who didn`t exactly enjoy the main two characters I`m recommending this because I watched all of clannad then the tomoyo side story who was my personal favorite and it was pretty satisfying. Not sure if it would have been without watching most of clannad. It might have been good standalone but I`ll never know</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"803616\">I can`t remember laughing/smiling so much (Clannad) &amp; crying so much (Clannad: After Story) within one anime, would recommend to anyone with emotions.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"219832\">For every anime fan who loves romantic and drama anime . This anime is the best in this category that i have ever seen</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"242116\">They`ve rewritten the path of Comedy/Romance</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"35101\">Superb animation after Kanon 2006! It is either this will be my no.1 or Kanon 2006 will be my no.1!! CLANNAD is a must must must watch anime of the year! It rocks! Story the best! Characters the best!</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"525522\">I watched Angel Beats! and was searching for other animes made by the same people because it was so good. I found this series and other Key titles and have watched them all. I am proud to say this series (Clannad and After Story) is by far my favorite anime of all time. It has everything, except ecchi, that a perfect story need. It has romance, comedy, some action, character progression, and tragedy. I make a point to watch this anime every few months just because nothing really compares to it, and that`s saying a lot as I`ve seen a ton of shows. I`ve played the game(waiting on Tomoyo After to be translated) and this is honestly one of the best animes based off of a visual novel. You will not regret watching this anime. So sit down, grab your girlfriend/wife, and show her what a real romance is and stop watching those cheesy movies that they all drag you to.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"366490\">This anime make me addicted , OMG if this continue to season 3 (i hope) , i will going to blast....</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"324595\">+98%:  story, character\n-2%:  needs more ecchiness\n\nMasterpiece.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"408018\">yust watch the best</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"340905\">great laugh, you will cry...</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"383828\">Definetely great, but not as good as the sequel.&lt;br /&gt;Still a MUST SEE.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"116870\">Heh. This one was on my HDD for years since I was avoiding it... it`s just another show on my list where I am regretting that I haven`t watched it sooner. It`s a great comedy with likeable chars and touching moments.\n\nThough, I have to say that I enjoyed one of the specials the most (Another World, Tomoyo Chapter).</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"480721\">Exceptional, daring, and bold are just some of the words to define the Clannad experience.  For a series to possess virtually everything except mechas, and tell it in a manner which draws in anybody who has seen it can only be the work of legends.    \n\nIt has been my and many people`s experience that after viewing Clannad, you will be completely engulfed and desiring more.  Miss this series, and you will undoubtedly regret it.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"353647\">Overwhelmingly awesome. It truly was a roller coaster ride watching this anime. It goes without saying that you must watch the second season with it (preferably in the one session).</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"419926\">This is one of the best animes ever along with its sequel. Very emotional, very funny at times and nice romance plot. Characters are all adorable. This is by all means a MUST SEE.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"232143\">Highly recommended. It`s sequel is definitely MUST SEE type, and more enjoyable if you know the background. Therefore I will rank this one as MUST SEE as well.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"114814\">This is one of the best anime out there, and I have seen quite a few.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"471794\">An absolute must see for anyone who appreciates anime genres such as school life. This one has a really involving plot and very good characters.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"495718\">the only anime to ever make me cry, seriously cry, and then bring me right back to a full smile. Bravo, absolutely watch this, beginning to ending.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"448871\">It`s really weird how this can be so funny and at the same time so touching. This is not only for school romance genre lovers, but for everyone.\nAlso girls were über cute in this series.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"461628\">Just must see for everyone</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"458655\">For anyone that can easily enjoy a high-school-slice-of-life. Has pretty good comedy value within it. But there`s more to this show than just comedy. And with an amazing sequel!</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"339854\">A Must-See All The Way! By the end, u`ll might even get a tear in ur eye like me</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"346737\">It`s very good, and what make`s it even better is the sequel... at the very least, watch this so you can watch one of the best Drama`s in history : Clannad After Story</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"444806\">You HAVE to watch this.\n\nGreat animation, awesomes characters development and story, lots of fun and tears.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"54433\">Beautiful, nice story, so many feelings inside, a must see!</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"464173\">i don`t cry, my wife was looking at me like a moron cuz she don`t watch anime and she`s never seen me cry and i was straight up crying. So emotional and definitely worth watching</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"241728\">The story behind this show is so well done. Definitely a must see.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"453138\">A good anime to watch as a starter, this was probably the 2nd anime I watched and I loved it. If you are hooked in the first two minutes like me then you`ll more than likely love it. Little to no ecchi scenes which is a huge plus. \nOverall a good anime to watch that involves school and drama involving each girls arc.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"487479\">A few years ago I tried watching the first episode and thought the animation wasn`t that good so I wasn`t gonna finish it. Skip to 2010 and I decide to watch it, it hooked me. Everything from the music to the characters to the storyline was so damn awesome. BTW, Dango Daikazoku is my lullaby.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"385944\">Clannad is by far one of the best animes when it comes regarding life. relationships.\nThe character are very well developed and the soundtrack is by far breathtaking \nThis anime went to my top with Fuko arc, i cried so much.\nGive it a try, if you are a fan of this gender you will not regret ever watching it</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"495174\">Clannad had done a superb job being funny and enjoyable throughout the series without losing focus on its storyline. The best anime of its kind</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"183526\">Masterpiece. It makes you laugh in one second, and it makes you shiver of anxiety the second after.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"54309\">You will laugh, cry, cheer, never regret watching this and won`t ever forget it. Just complete.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"536175\">It`s not that good but you must watch it in order to watch its sequel because it`s the best anime in the world</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"550129\">One of my favorites. I recommend watching \"after story\" right after, otherwise impression won`t be complete. And playing the VN beforehand.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"492184\">best anime ever</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"176469\">As expected, another great product of Kyoto animation.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"135495\">I cant recommend this anime enough, my favourite of all time and I`ve seen alot. Its just just a fact of \"If you want to\", this is a \"MUST SEE\", and definately in the original Japanese, the dub doesnt do it justice. Best for story, soundtrack, plot, artwork and anything you can imagine. Sure with both seasons 52 episodes is alot but trust me, you`ll be crying half-way through!</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"339155\">one of the best series i ever seen.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"281330\">One of the best.I realy loved it ,so i highly recommend.The second season is ohh how should i put it                BRILIANT :D</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"256742\">EPIC!!!</recommendation>\n</recommendations>\n<url>http://www.tbs.co.jp/clannad/clannad1/index-j.html</url>\n<creators>\n<name id=\"1046\" type=\"Original Work\">Visual Art`s/Key</name>\n<name id=\"736\" type=\"Animation Work\">Kyoto Animation</name>\n<name id=\"525\" type=\"Character Design\">Ikeda Kazumi</name>\n<name id=\"535\" type=\"Series Composition\">Shimo Fumihiko</name>\n<name id=\"519\" type=\"Direction\">Ishihara Tatsuya</name>\n<name id=\"525\" type=\"Chief Animation Direction\">Ikeda Kazumi</name>\n<name id=\"1859\" type=\"Music\">Orito Shinji</name>\n<name id=\"1860\" type=\"Music\">Togoshi Magome</name>\n<name id=\"1855\" type=\"Music\">Maeda Jun</name>\n</creators>\n<description>* Based on a visual novel by http://anidb.net/cr1046 [Visual Art`s/Key].\nhttp://anidb.net/ch1113 [Okazaki Tomoya] is a third-year student at a high school somewhere in Japan, and does not take his studies seriously. Always late for class, he is seen as a delinquent by the rest of his classmates who are busy preparing for their college entrance examinations. Needless to say, he does not have too many close friends.\nTomoya does not seem to mind though — until one day he meets a girl, http://anidb.net/ch1116 [Furukawa Nagisa], who is left alone without friends at school because everybody she knew already graduated. \"What a clumsy girl\", he thinks at first. But talking to her feels natural and so, while helping her, he meets a few other girls from his school. Although he does not care much about them at first, he soon opens his heart as they get to know each other better.</description>\n<ratings>\n<permanent count=\"10769\">8.03</permanent>\n<temporary count=\"10962\">8.25</temporary>\n<review count=\"10\">7.61</review>\n</ratings>\n<picture>221700.jpg</picture>\n<resources>\n<resource type=\"1\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>7809</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"2\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>4059</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>2167</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"3\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>4016</identifier>\n<identifier>grewud</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"4\">\n<externalentity>\n<url>http://www.tbs.co.jp/clannad/clannad1/index-j.html</url>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"6\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>Clannad_(visual_novel)</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"7\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>CLANNAD_(ゲーム)</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"8\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>1225</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"9\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>328813</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"10\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>9418</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"11\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>mediadb/media/2077</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"14\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>4</identifier>\n<identifier>v</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"15\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>2007/clannad</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"31\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>10176</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>10868</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n</resources>\n<tags>\n<tag id=\"30\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-10\">\n<name>maintenance tags</name>\n<description>These tags are used for maintenance.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1152\" parentid=\"2849\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2010-04-23\">\n<name>undead</name>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1471\" parentid=\"2653\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2020-06-16\">\n<name>bad cooking</name>\n<description>The character is hopelessly terrible at cooking, and any attempts he or she makes at making even the simplest dishes are spectacular failures.</description>\n<picurl>248445.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1802\" parentid=\"2606\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2016-01-24\">\n<name>seinen</name>\n<description>Seinen, literally \"young man\", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones.

Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2606\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-05\">\n<name>target audience</name>\n<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-04-29\">\n<name>themes</name>\n<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2609\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-01\">\n<name>original work</name>\n<description>What the anime is based on!

This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.\nA world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a \"more than cursory\" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.\nThe fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.\nA fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2630\" parentid=\"2613\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-10-13\">\n<name>Earth</name>\n<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>\n<picurl>126792.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2648\" parentid=\"2849\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-11-04\">\n<name>contemporary fantasy</name>\n<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.\nThese terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.\nNovels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.\nContemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.\nIn his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about \"magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels\", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: \"I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales\". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.\nSource: wiki</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2653\" parentid=\"2853\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-05-04\">\n<name>slapstick</name>\n<description>Slapstick humour is generally recognized by lots of physical abuse, horseplay and practical jokes.

There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>\n<picurl>210065.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2672\" parentid=\"2834\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-03-05\">\n<name>Japan</name>\n<description>Japan is a sovereign island nation in East Asia.

To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.\nMultiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple \"World Lines\", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2844\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-01-21\">\n<name>angst</name>\n<description>A feeling of general discomfort and uneasiness is present due to either trivial or more serious reasons, often accompanied by depression.\nWarning: may contain copious amounts of brooding and sighing.\nEtymology: \"Angst\" is a German word meaning fear or anxiety.</description>\n<picurl>212183.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2849\" parentid=\"7050\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2005-05-07\">\n<name>fantasy</name>\n<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).\nIn popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture\nSource: Wiki</description>\n<picurl>68768.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2853\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-02-13\">\n<name>comedy</name>\n<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results.

Romance is also a difficulty encountered when creating a harem.</description>\n<picurl>210061.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2859\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2016-09-04\">\n<name>harem</name>\n<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a \"http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]\", or sometimes also \"male harem\". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.\nAs a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.\nMost of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called \"harem ending\".</description>\n<picurl>94602.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2862\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-01-21\">\n<name>friendship</name>\n<description>The feeling of trust, kindness, and friendship between a group of high school students for example, is a central theme of this anime.</description>\n<picurl>65691.png</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2864\" parentid=\"2607\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>daily life</name>\n<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life.

Language, behaviour, or events which resemble melodramas are also called melodramatic. In scholarly and historical musical contexts melodramas are dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action.\nMelodrama is a style of drama that has been applied on the stage, in movies and television, and radio formats, from the 18th century to the present. Because of the long timeframe in which the style has existed, it is difficult to derive a precise definition. The term melodrama is most often used pejoratively, to suggest that the work to which the term is applied lacks sophistication or subtlety.\nThe term originated from the early 19th-century French word mélodrame, which is derived from Greek melos, music, and French drame, drama (from Late Latin drāma, which in turn derives from Greek drān, to do, perform).\nSource: wiki</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"5865\" parentid=\"2931\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"false\" update=\"2009-05-22\">\n<name>manly tears</name>\n<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the \"norm\" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call \"manly tears\". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows.

She is currently the class representative of her class. She has a pet baby boar named Botan.
