When he was on his way home he witnessed a shocking view as the world suddenly froze: people were engulfed by blue flames and a monster resembling a large doll swallowed them. Just as the monster prepared to consume Yuuji, a sword-wielding girl in black attire with flaming red eyes and hair that burns like embers saved him from the monster. The girl called herself a \\\"Flame Haze\\\" who hunts the \\\"Guze no Tomogara\\\", creatures from another world. As Yuuji noticed a blue flame in his chest, she called him a \\\"Torch\\\", a temporary replacement, saying that the \\\"real\\\" Yuuji's existence had already ended. Unfazed, Yuuji befriended the strange girl, named her \\\"Shana\\\", and joined her fight against Tomogara and other Flame Hazes.\",\"first_aired\":\"2005-10-04T15:45:00.000Z\",\"airs\":{\"day\":\"Wednesday\",\"time\":\"00:45\",\"timezone\":\"Asia/Tokyo\"},\"runtime\":25,\"certification\":null,\"network\":\"tvk\",\"country\":\"jp\",\"trailer\":null,\"homepage\":\"http://www.shakugan.com/\",\"status\":\"ended\",\"rating\":7.50617,\"votes\":243,\"comment_count\":1,\"updated_at\":\"2019-12-13T08:41:24.000Z\",\"language\":\"ja\",\"available_translations\":[\"de\",\"en\",\"es\",\"fr\",\"he\",\"ko\",\"pt\",\"ru\",\"zh\"],\"genres\":[\"action\",\"drama\",\"adventure\",\"anime\",\"fantasy\",\"romance\"],\"aired_episodes\":72}","headers":{},"request":{"uri":{"protocol":"https:","slashes":true,"auth":null,"host":"api.trakt.tv","port":443,"hostname":"api.trakt.tv","hash":null,"search":"?extended=full","query":"extended=full","pathname":"/shows/61174","path":"/shows/61174?extended=full","href":"https://api.trakt.tv/shows/61174?extended=full"},"method":"GET","headers":{}}}
