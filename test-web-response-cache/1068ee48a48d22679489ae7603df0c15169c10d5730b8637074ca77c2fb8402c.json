Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.\nThere is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.\nIn anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.\nOne-off appearances of characters in swimsuits should not be tagged.</description>\n<picurl>69059.png</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2520\" parentid=\"6149\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2016-09-04\">\n<name>school swimsuit</name>\n<description>A school swimsuit (also known as sukumizu, shorthand for school mizugi) is a standardised navy blue one-piece swimsuit worn by schoolgirls. Typically they also have a name tag on the front. Sukumizu can also be black or white.\nNormally worn at schools though sometimes also worn at beaches when the character feels this to be easier, forgot to buy a normal swimsuit of their own or wants to give some fan service to those that like school swimsuits better than regular swimsuits.\nIn http://anidb.net/t2856 [ecchi] anime, a swimsuit of this type sometimes serves censoring purposes when characters take a bath. If there is a group of female characters donning swimsuits, you can expect the youngest or youngest-looking girl to wear one of these.</description>\n<picurl>52174.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2578\" parentid=\"6149\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-11-12\">\n<name>vulgar</name>\n<description>Talking (and acting) in a way that is considered uncultivated, bawdy, common, coarse or unrefined, or \"taboo\" according to existing cultural standards.

Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2606\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-05\">\n<name>target audience</name>\n<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-04-29\">\n<name>themes</name>\n<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2608\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-12-04\">\n<name>fetishes</name>\n<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2609\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-01\">\n<name>original work</name>\n<description>What the anime is based on!

It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>\n<picurl>126792.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2652\" parentid=\"2853\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-01-21\">\n<name>super deformed</name>\n<description>A caricature style often seen in anime when the character shows extreme emotions, like fear, anger, happiness, surprise, or shame.

When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes</description>\n<picurl>32416.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2858\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>romance</name>\n<description>Romance describes a story that deals with love between two or more characters typically also having an optimistic ending.

Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a \"http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]\", or sometimes also \"male harem\". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.\nAs a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.\nMost of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called \"harem ending\".</description>\n<picurl>94602.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2864\" parentid=\"2607\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>daily life</name>\n<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life.

But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.\nOf course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.\nIn rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>\n<picurl>38239.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"3185\" parentid=\"2853\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2011-04-27\">\n<name>wordplay</name>\n<description>The characters play with words. \nE.g. purposely or accidentally use similar-sounding but wrongly applied words in the Japanese original, leading to supposedly funny misunderstandings and confusion.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4333\" parentid=\"6230\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2015-07-06\">\n<name>predominantly female cast</name>\n<description>A show with a predominantly female cast has mostly females as main and secondary cast members while few if any male characters have major roles.

She comes from an affluent family and is the most mature character in appearance. However, she has a strongly perverted mind; like Shino, she seems to twist every word and thought into something sexual. Because she is absurdly rich and overly pampered,she can be a social airhead: for instance, she waits in front of a door and expects it to slide open or stands at the bottom of the stairs like she is boarding an escalator. However, she is academically smart as she ranks second, right under Shino, on midterms for her class year. Her chest is larger than Shino`s, which causes the latter to feel self-conscious.\nSource: Wiki</description>\n<picture>47813.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"162\" picture=\"23208.jpg\">Satou Satomi</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"17550\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2013-11-29\">\n<rating votes=\"171\">7.03</rating>\n<name>Mitsuba Mutsumi</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Mitsuba Mutsumi is Takatoshi`s classmate who forms a judo club at the start of the series.

She is serious and diligent, excels in academics, and is very popular among the student body. However, she is almost always thinking of perverted things. She suggests that one of her original reasons she shows interest in Takatoshi is so she can observe him in health and physical education classes. She fears heights and insects, and her rather flat chest makes her feel self-conscious, especially when comparing herself to Aria. She is occasionally shown doing couple-like activities with Takatoshi such as walking with him, sharing an umbrella or clearing his earwax, but gets embarrassed whenever Takatoshi says something to her that could be interpreted as romantic.
