With their armies largely destroyed they are unable to resist his subsequent scorched-earth tactics. The emperor`s daughter, Pinya, is ordered to lead her order of knights to investigate the JSDF and learn all she can about them.\nMeanwhile, back on Earth, the President of the United States considers sending an American force beyond the Gate as well, lured by the prospect of immense resources in the lands beyond, despite the political implications. Domestic opposition in Japan to the JSDF`s operation beyond the Gate is mounting as well, so the President is convinced to bide his time.\nYouji is made commander of a reconnaissance unit whose job is to make contact with the locals and establish friendly relations with them.

They see a battlefield full of dead dragons killed by the JSDF during the last battle, and attempt to harvest the dragon scales and trade them at the nearby city of Italica.\nAt the same time, Pinya travels throughout the lands and hears stories of the doings of the JSDF from some of the survivors of Coda Village.

This is Pina`s first true battle: her Knights were relegated solely to a ceremonial role before, and she is not doing well.

However, the characters miss depth as there’s hardly any character development at all which results in somewhat shallow characters. I wish there was more drama as well.\nI found season 2 to be slightly better. Overall a 7/10.

No frontal (visible genitals) = 1.5 stars or less.\nPeople, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.\nThough the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia.

When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes"},"picurl":{"_text":"32416.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2858","parentid":"2611","weight":"200","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2017-12-01"},"name":{"_text":"romance"},"description":{"_text":"Romance describes a story that deals with love between two or more characters typically also having an optimistic ending.

Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a \"http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]\", or sometimes also \"male harem\". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.\nAs a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.\nMost of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called \"harem ending\"."},"picurl":{"_text":"94602.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2867","parentid":"2607","weight":"200","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2012-10-08"},"name":{"_text":"politics"},"description":{"_text":"From commies to fat capitalist pigs, all the stuff done by the \"guys with the power\", mainly evil tactics for gaining more power over the masses.\nWatching this title may remind you why CNN is boring."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2872","parentid":"2607","weight":"100","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2009-04-16"},"name":{"_text":"crime"},"description":{"_text":"The underworld we talk about here is not to be confused with the place where people are believed to go after they die, but the general term for organized crime.

The desired result is a change of the attitude toward the subject in the target audience to further a political agenda."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"5150","parentid":"2925","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2014-02-11"},"name":{"_text":"asymmetric warfare"},"description":{"_text":"Asymmetric warfare is war between conflicting groups whose relative military power differs, or whose strategy or tactics differ significantly.\nAsymmetric warfare can describe a conflict in which the resources of two groups differ in essence, and in the struggle, they interact and attempt to exploit each other`s weaknesses."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"5485","parentid":"7199","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2010-04-28"},"name":{"_text":"penis jokes"},"description":{"_text":"A penis or other phallic object is used as a device to elicit laughter from the viewer.

The new world is commonly a http://anidb.net/t2628 [fictional world], such as a http://anidb.net/t2838 [parallel world] or http://anidb.net/t2839 [virtual world]; other fictional world types can also apply. Once transferred, they must use the abilities and knowledge brought from their former world as well as any that may have been bestowed upon them by their brave new world. In some cases, they will seek and eventually find a way to return; in others, they will gleefully embrace their new life.\nThe misnomer \"reverse isekai\" is sometimes used to describe when characters from another world are sent to Earth, in an inaccurate usage likely born out of a mistaken notion that isekai is designed solely around transfers of earthlings. Rather, isekai is about the transfer itself; the identity of the origin and destination worlds, or the direction in which the transfer occurs, are not relevant. What defines isekai is that the characters are sent to another world, often but not always a parallel one, and that they generally cannot come back permanently without meeting a highly specific goal.\nBroadly speaking, the following major characteristics, from most to least important, define the isekai theme:\n1. The characters are trapped in a new world that is not the one they lived in up to then. This new world is usually unknown to them, at least in part, but that is not strictly mandatory. Generally speaking, while exceptions may apply, pure time travel does not qualify; there must be a change of location.\n2. The trapping is, at least initially, permanent; there must be no quick and easy escape route back to their home world. A known way back may exist from the outset, but it requires effort, such as clearing the 100th floor of a difficult dungeon or defeating the demon lord; alternatively, it may be eventually found or developed.\n3. The transfer to the isekai world was not intentional on the part of those being transferred. For example, it may have been orchestrated by a third party (malicious or otherwise), it may have been an accident, and the universe itself could be the actor responsible."},"picurl":{"_text":"210952.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"7050","parentid":"2611","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2019-04-18"},"name":{"_text":"speculative fiction"},"description":{"_text":"Speculative fiction is an umbrella genre encompassing fiction with certain elements that do not exist in the real world, often in the context of supernatural, futuristic or other imaginative themes.

Pinya and a Japanese diplomat have begun meeting with imperial nobles, attempting to convince the most hawkish of them to consider peace with Japan by giving them gifts and negotiating the release of important prisoners of war captured during the first assault by the Empire against Japan.\nMeanwhile, Itami is at a tavern with Rory, who is still trying to seduce him. A dark elf woman named Yao Ha Dyusshi appears, looking for what she calls the \"green men\" (the JSDF) trying to get their help. She denounces Itami for apparently corrupting a minor, and her interference irritates Rory. She makes the misunderstanding deep enough that the Yao draws her sword on Itami, who flees. It turns out that Yao is looking for help to finally finish off the fire dragon that Itami`s group encountered earlier, and offers a huge diamond as reward."},"resources":{"resource":{"_attributes":{"type":"28"},"externalentity":{"identifier":[{"_text":"682133"},{"_text":"gate"}]}}}},{"_attributes":{"id":"189488","update":"2017-07-25"},"epno":{"_attributes":{"type":"2"},"_text":"S2"},"length":{"_text":"1"},"rating":{"_attributes":{"votes":"1"},"_text":"1.34"},"title":{"_attributes":{"xml:lang":"en"},"_text":"Comic 2"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"189489","update":"2017-07-25"},"epno":{"_attributes":{"type":"2"},"_text":"S1"},"length":{"_text":"1"},"rating":{"_attributes":{"votes":"1"},"_text":"7.55"},"title":{"_attributes":{"xml:lang":"en"},"_text":"Comic 1"}}]}}},"episodes":12}}}}
