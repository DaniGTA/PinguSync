If you love horror and gore this is for you.\nIf you love Yandere, this is D-E-F-I-N-I-T-E-L-Y for you. \n\nPS: Enjoy</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"298878\">If you thought Elfen Lied was great then watch this ^.^</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"288423\">amazing anime</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"83851\">Greatest anime I`ve ever seen, as well as greatest horror I`ve ever seen. Plot is amazing and suprising.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"553117\">Delightfully twisted! Just the right mix between love and death by baseball bat.\n\nA must see if you like this genre.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"592505\">A deep and fascinating anime that exhibits a well-crafted and twisted story-arc plot with likeable yet mad characters. Add some insanely violent contrast moments, a scary ambiance of tales folklore and smart dialogs and you`ll get a profoundly dreadful anime for mature public.\n\nI really enjoyed the progressive and detailed story-puzzle, that some may dislike due to repetitive patterns in the arcs but give the viewer joy trying barely to guess what`s next, the surprisingly-smart decisive dialogs and the well-developed mentality states such as trust, dementia and manipulation.\n\nRecommended if you like Death Note`s complex plot, Elfen Lied`s ultra-violence (careful kids) and horror coupling with mystery.\n\nSpecial mention for the OP, a real piece of art.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"257932\">Alluringly disturbing, uncomfortable.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"214346\">WTF? Scarry and wicked sick.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"417398\">One of my favorites  in it`s genre is what I should start off with. It`s filled with blood, gore, and characters taking turns to become psychotic. The plot can be a little bit confusing but as you go on, it will psychologically disturb you. When you watch though, it`s highly recommended that you watch the second season. It will answer the questions left behind on this season.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"243995\">If you haven`t seen this, you haven`t seen anything...\nYou`re missing out a really disturbing series full of angst and violence. Really great stuff, if you are into this type of genre.\n\nDidn`t get what was going on? No problem, I didn`t get it either at first. \nThere is a reason why there is a second season called \"Kai\" (solution) after all… \nFor all those unanswered questions you might have, watch the second season, which is great too.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"492032\">Oh My God!!! What can I tell. This is the most twisted anime i`ve wached. And it`s brutal. You must see it but you have to have strong nerves for this.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"398971\">Insane and insanely good. The plot will suck you into it and you won`t be able to stop watching this once you start. In one sense the first series has no real ending, but that`s what the second season is there for. So if you liked this, make sure you watch Higurashi: Kai as well.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"301359\">Simply put: A must see for any anime fan!\nThe music, animation, characters, story, everything is top notch!</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"267233\">Very beautiful storyline.  It might be a bit confusing for most people, however, that is because of a certain spoiler that will be revealed late in the season (or start of second season).  But it is very well done in terms of pacing and very beautiful in terms of concept.  The music is good and well, there just isn`t enough time to say everything.  Just watch it and see for yourself!</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"139150\">watch this THEN \"kai\" after which is sequel, if you dont understand story, keep watching, it will all be explained once everything is presented</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"567315\">Unless you absolutely hate the genre, this is a must-see show. It is very unique, and an exciting watch. yes, there are some gut-wrenching scenes that make you cringe, and yes there are some sugary-sweet moments too, but the art of this anime is in the combination of the two. That said, NEVER read the comments on the episodes of this show, they are almost always filled with spoilers, or people explaining the whole show because they think they know what it`s about after finishing it. Just watch it and enjoy it for yourself! ^_^</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"359130\">Kept me on the edge of my seat!  Very gruesome anime and mysterious too!</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"284709\">You probably wont understand a thing when you see this. It`s basically a bunch of short stories concerning the same characters in the same time, but with different turnout. Only some basic events are the same. But everything will get clear in the end of season 1 or beginning of season 2. Realy great story. Nice plot idea. Must see.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"224300\">The most twisted and disturbing show released so far imo</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"210645\">Perfect psycho series.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"305044\">There are no series that even remotely resemble Higurashi. A must see for anyone who isnt afraid of probably the darkest series of all times.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"321710\">Very twisted anime. Never too sure about whats going on. Weird twists throughout the entire series.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"360581\">A must see! Over and over again =P</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"313872\">scary/weird/unbelievable at same point (yes, even for anime!): it`s a must see from a mile away!!!</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"372851\">I like horror animes and this is the best horror anime i have seen. You just have to watch this if you are into horror.\nIt is very interesting and enjoyable</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"219832\">One of the best animes i have ever seen , the story is unique , and i am sure you will not regret watching it</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"317829\">A great mystery coated with lovable characters and a thrilling plot.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"260880\">really dark ,really fascinating</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"469237\">Yes. One of the best thriller atmospheres I`ve experienced. A very nice made story, with a lot of overturns.

Insanity may manifest as violations of societal norms, including a person becoming a danger to themselves or others, though not all such acts are considered insanity; likewise, not all acts showing indifference toward societal norms are acts of insanity.\nIn modern usage, insanity is most commonly encountered as an informal unscientific term denoting mental instability, or in the narrow legal context of the insanity defense.\nA more informal use of the term insanity is to denote something or someone considered highly unique, passionate or extreme, including in a positive sense. The term may also be used as an attempt to discredit or criticise particular ideas, beliefs, principles, desires, personal feelings, attitudes, or their proponents, such as in politics and religion.\nSource: Wikipedia</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"308\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-17\">\n<name>detective</name>\n<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.\nSource: Wikipedia</description>\n<picurl>210906.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1018\" parentid=\"2869\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2010-05-25\">\n<name>middle school</name>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1286\" parentid=\"6149\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2008-12-28\">\n<name>megalomaniac</name>\n<description>Megalomania is a psychopathological condition characterized by delusional fantasies of power, relevance, and omnipotence, and by inflated self-esteem.&#13;\n&#13;\nSource: Wikipedia</description>\n<picurl>70559.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1802\" parentid=\"2606\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2016-01-24\">\n<name>seinen</name>\n<description>Seinen, literally \"young man\", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>\n<picurl>181651.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2604\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-08\">\n<name>content indicators</name>\n<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-28\">\n<name>dynamic</name>\n<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: \nPlot Continuity \nHow does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2606\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-05\">\n<name>target audience</name>\n<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-04-29\">\n<name>themes</name>\n<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2609\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-01\">\n<name>original work</name>\n<description>What the anime is based on!

It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>\n<picurl>126792.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2653\" parentid=\"2853\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-05-04\">\n<name>slapstick</name>\n<description>Slapstick humour is generally recognized by lots of physical abuse, horseplay and practical jokes.

The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in \"the Russian mafia\" or \"the Japanese mafia\", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves \"cosa nostra\", while the Japanese mafia calls itself \"yakuza\".\nSource: Wikipedia</description>\n<picurl>211289.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2844\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-01-21\">\n<name>angst</name>\n<description>A feeling of general discomfort and uneasiness is present due to either trivial or more serious reasons, often accompanied by depression.\nWarning: may contain copious amounts of brooding and sighing.\nEtymology: \"Angst\" is a German word meaning fear or anxiety.</description>\n<picurl>212183.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2851\" parentid=\"7050\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-03-11\">\n<name>horror</name>\n<description>The horror cinematic genre is characterized by the attempt to make the viewer experience dread, fear, terror, or horror.

These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.\nJapanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>\n<picurl>198104.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2856\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-05\">\n<name>ecchi</name>\n<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes</description>\n<picurl>32416.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2862\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-01-21\">\n<name>friendship</name>\n<description>The feeling of trust, kindness, and friendship between a group of high school students for example, is a central theme of this anime.</description>\n<picurl>65691.png</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2869\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>school life</name>\n<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school.

Thus, over the years it became a norm to invest more time and money into the first and last episode, leaving many episodes in the middle to stand severe budget restrictions. This sometimes results in episodes which particularly stand out due to the drop in artwork or animation quality; bar some basic framework, they often have little in common with the rest of the series.\nOne clue to upcoming off-model animation is the noticeable addition of many Korean names in the production credits, as farming out more animation to Korean artists is a nearly universal indicator of a production company trying to save money in all possible ways.\nThis effect is often called yashigani, after the infamous http://anidb.net/e4682 [fourth episode] of http://anidb.net/a403 [Lost Universe], Yashigani Hoburu. Another prominent term describing the same effect is \"QUALITY animation\", with capital letters meant to show contrast to actual quality. http://anidb.net/a4531 [Yoake Mae yori Ruriiro na: Crescent Love] is another legendarily terrible offender: the TV airing of its http://anidb.net/e63752 [third episode] had a perfectly spherical ball in place of what should be a cabbage; the \"cabbage\" was so egregious that it became closely associated with the anime itself, to a point the show would henceforth be nicknamed \"Cabbage Love\" among Western viewers.\nOne should not confuse the yashigani effect with art shifts that stem from guest staff, changes in main staff, intentional art shifts, and similar effects. Another effect one shouldn`t confuse this one with is the so-called DVD/BD enhancement, which is when a studio scrambles to meet the deadline for a TV airing and airs a half-finished episode but eventually fixes it for a disk release; for example, http://anidb.net/cr792 [Shaft] is particularly infamous for its disk enhancements, to a point it has become known as \"Shafting\", and they prominently feature intentionally weird character models, but they don`t often leave bad artwork on the disk release. Additionally, it should also not be confused with intentional lack of detail on background plane characters; this effect is instead when even the foreground has art quality shifting over time due to the aforementioned budget restrictions.</description>\n<picurl>29532.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"3834\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2019-11-24\">\n<name>impending death -- TO BE SPLIT AND DELETED</name>\n<description>At least one character in this show is going to or very likely to die soon because of a http://anidb.net/t2574 [terminal illness], of a http://anidb.net/t2874 [disaster] such a http://anidb.net/t2925 [war], an http://anidb.net/t5466 [epidemic] (including the zombie apocalypse), or of other life-threatening reasons.

These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term \"splatter cinema\" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.\n[Source: wiki]</description>\n<picurl>32491.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4196\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-01-23\">\n<name>fate worse than death</name>\n<description>If you think death is the worst that can ever happen to someone, you had better think again: at least one character in this show is sure to end up in such a terrible way that many people would likely have preferred death if they had the choice.

She has a distinctive style of speech, ending all of her sentences with ~wa. In spite of her young age, she seems to have an impressive arm strength and is quite clever in setting up traps, and likes to practice on Keiichi. Although her personality is quite energetic and mischievous during the events of the games, Satoko`s past is full of trauma.</description>\n<picture>71974.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"70\" picture=\"171604.jpg\">Kanai Mika</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"1859\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2011-07-10\">\n<rating votes=\"60\">1.95</rating>\n<name>Houjou Satoshi</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Satoshi is the older brother of Satoko Hojo. Although he is currently missing, his past influence is the key to the actions of several characters in Higurashi. Similar to Satoko, he cannot distinguish the difference between cauliflower and broccoli. Due to this, it can be inferred that both Satoshi and Satoko are color-blind. Satoshi is referred to by Satoko as nii-nii, a childish form of the Japanese word ani (meaning older brother).\nAccording to the TIPS in Meakashi-hen, he was last seen at a Nagoya train station boarding a Shinkansen bound for Tokyo. This was revealed prior to the start of Matsuribayashi-hen to be a result of him trying to run away from home due to his abuse, only to change his mind a few moments later. While it is suggested that he may have witnessed his aunt`s death in the games, In the anime, Satoshi is implied to have killed her or was so disturbed that he believed he did. Combined with the stress of taking care of Satoko and the murder, he succumbs to Hinamizawa Syndrome. In Matsuribayashi-hen, at least in the anime, and in Miotsukushi-hen, it is revealed that Doctor Irie put him under heavy sedation in the underground parts of the clinic, while in the visual novel equivalent, he is still alive yet his whereabouts are unknown.</description>\n<picture>75111.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"79\" picture=\"228519.jpg\">Kobayashi Yuu</seiyuu>\n<seiyuu id=\"180\" picture=\"171567.jpg\">Saiga Mitsuki</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"1860\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2009-01-04\">\n<rating votes=\"71\">6.21</rating>\n<name>Ooishi Kuraudo</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Kuraudo Oishi is a veteran police investigator at Okinomiya who has vowed to solve the mystery of the Hinamizawa murders before his retirement, to avenge one of the victims he was friends with.

He approaches one of the main characters to become his informant in several arcs, and is sometimes unwittingly responsible for triggering their paranoia.</description>\n<picture>16494.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"173\" picture=\"150067.jpg\">Chafuurin</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"1861\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2011-04-09\">\n<rating votes=\"45\">4.78</rating>\n<name>Tomitake Jirou</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Jiro Tomitake is a freelance photographer who occasionally visits Hinamizawa (Around three times every year). He gets along well with Miyo Takano, because of their similar interests in photography. Despite being only an occasional visitor, he seems to know a fair amount about Hinamizawa`s past (Specifically the Hinamizawa murders). Oishi and the police are suspicious of his true identity.\nIn the first six arcs, he is consistently found dead of suicide (clawing his throat out) on the night of Watanagashi, triggering many of the events that follow. It is revealed later, however, that he was actually murdered by Miyo, who gives him an injection of the H173 drug, produced in the process of developing a cure for the Hinamizawa Syndrome, but has the exact opposite effect (incurring the symptoms of the disease instead).</description>\n<picture>16496.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"382\" picture=\"228600.jpg\">Ookawa Tooru</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"1862\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2011-07-10\">\n<rating votes=\"117\">5.91</rating>\n<name>Takano Miyo</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Miyo is a nurse at the village clinic who has a keen interest in Hinamizawa`s past and culture, recording all her speculations in notebooks.

Later, however, it turns out that she is the mastermind of the events taking place in Hinamizawa who wants to murder Rika as part of her plan to have revenge on the people who spurned her grandfather`s research. It is revealed that she fakes her death through the first six arcs of the story (the corpse in the barrel being a stolen corpse), and murders Rika in three of the arcs after which she also kills everyone in Hinamizawa. Her original name is Miyoko Tanashi, but she changed it when she was adopted by Hifume Takano after her parents died, who was the one who start Miyo on the path of medicine with his study of Hinamizawa Syndrome.</description>\n<picture>75110.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"229\" picture=\"152363.jpg\">Itou Miki</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"1863\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2009-01-04\">\n<rating votes=\"66\">3.67</rating>\n<name>Irie Kyousuke</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Kyosuke is the head doctor of the village clinic.

In addition, he is the manager of the village`s baseball little league team, the Hinamizawa Fighters.\nIt is later revealed that he works under Miyo, where he is trying to find a cure for Hinamizawa Syndrome while not knowing of his employer`s true desires.</description>\n<picture>16498.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"384\" picture=\"17230.jpg\">Seki Toshihiko</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"1864\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2009-06-25\">\n<rating votes=\"77\">5.41</rating>\n<name>Chie Rumiko</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Rumiko is the female teacher of Keiichi`s class, a parody character of Tsukihime`s Ciel-senpai (permission for her usage was given by Type-Moon).
