When it gets dark, they attack innocent citizens and feed on their flesh. Externally, they are indistinguishable from their fellow human beings. And worse: they live in the middle of us! Who knows, maybe the nice girl from the caf√© or the neighbor next door has a little weakness for human flesh ?! So it's no wonder that bookworm and freshman Ken lands in the middle of a ghula's arms. Cute Rize is too great to be true: her first date with Ken even takes place in a bookstore! But when she leaves, she reveals her true nature and attacks Ken. Ken survives the ghoul attack by an incredible coincidence - but with serious injuries.
