It`s very rare that such episodes work both as standalone stories and also as prequels since both provide context but also ask and answer interesting questions. I would say these were even better than S1, except they wouldn`t have worked as they did if it wasn`t for that very season.\n\nHopefully this recommendation was as vague and spoiler-free as I intended it to be... I would say a must-watch for fans and in general the series is something that all anime-lovers should give a go.</recommendation>\n</recommendations>\n<url>http://www.marv.jp/special/tokyoghoul/products_ova.html</url>\n<creators>\n<name id=\"724\" type=\"Animation Work\">Studio Pierrot</name>\n<name id=\"19338\" type=\"Character Design\">Kurihara Manabu</name>\n<name id=\"3631\" type=\"Character Design\">Miwa Kazuhiro</name>\n<name id=\"40358\" type=\"Music\">Yamada Yutaka</name>\n<name id=\"39476\" type=\"Original Work\">Ishida Sui</name>\n<name id=\"8386\" type=\"Direction\">Matsubayashi Tadahito</name>\n<name id=\"44224\" type=\"Direction\">Shimada Souichi</name>\n</creators>\n<description>Note: Tokyo Ghoul Jack OVA received a limited engagement in select theaters in Japan from September 5 to September 18, ahead of its September 30, 2015 retail release.</description>\n<ratings>\n<permanent count=\"941\">5.40</permanent>\n<temporary count=\"948\">6.74</temporary>\n</ratings>\n<picture>178405.jpg</picture>\n<resources>\n<resource type=\"1\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>17375</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>17155</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"2\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>30458</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>31297</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"4\">\n<externalentity>\n<url>http://www.marv.jp/special/tokyoghoul/products_ova.html</url>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"9\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>353317</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>353549</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n</resources>\n<tags>\n<tag id=\"28\" parentid=\"2881\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2011-11-16\">\n<name>baseball</name>\n<description>Baseball is like a complicated version of Rounders.

Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2606\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-05\">\n<name>target audience</name>\n<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-04-29\">\n<name>themes</name>\n<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2609\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-01\">\n<name>original work</name>\n<description>What the anime is based on!

Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.\nIt`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.\nSee also http://anidb.net/t6493 [manhua] and http://anidb.net/t5010 [manhwa].</description>\n<picurl>215593.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2841\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-26\">\n<name>action</name>\n<description>Action anime usually involve a fairly straightforward story of good guys versus bad guys, where most disputes are resolved by using physical force.

These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.\nJapanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>\n<picurl>198104.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2856\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-05\">\n<name>ecchi</name>\n<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes</description>\n<picurl>32416.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2862\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-01-21\">\n<name>friendship</name>\n<description>The feeling of trust, kindness, and friendship between a group of high school students for example, is a central theme of this anime.</description>\n<picurl>65691.png</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2869\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>school life</name>\n<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school.

In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy. Maiming, or mutilation which involves the loss of, or incapacity to use, a bodily member, is and has been practised by many societies with various cultural and religious significances, and is also a customary form of physical punishment, especially applied on the principle of \"an eye for an eye\".\nSource: Wikipedia</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"3435\" parentid=\"2851\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2015-02-17\">\n<name>eating of humans</name>\n<description>The eating of humans, also called man-eating, is the practice of some species to prey on human beings for nourishment.

These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term \"splatter cinema\" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.\n[Source: wiki]</description>\n<picurl>32491.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4316\" parentid=\"6242\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-11\">\n<name>murder</name>\n<description>To murder means to bring about someone else`s death, by a voluntary act.

He had two childhood friends; http://anidb.net/ch76472 [Ryou], with whom he played baseball, and http://anidb.net/ch76471 [Aki], a girl whom he had a crush on. When Ryou associated himself with a gang of bikers, this led to his death, as he was stabbed by the Kagune of a killer Ghoul, Lantern, whom Arima was currently investigating. Witnessing his friend`s tragic death, Fura grew heated for vengeance, and pleaded with Arima to help with his investigation, wanting to know about ghouls right away. Thus, he eventually undertook the career of Ghoul Investigation.\nSource: Wikipedia</description>\n<picture>217969.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"2225\" picture=\"192115.jpg\">Kimura Ryouhei</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"76475\" type=\"main character in\" update=\"2018-05-26\">\n<rating votes=\"3\">6.40</rating>\n<name>Hori Chie</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>217982.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"27977\" picture=\"76416.jpg\">Han Megumi</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"76601\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2018-05-26\">\n<rating votes=\"12\">6.54</rating>\n<name>Fura Taishi</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Fura Taishi is a First-Class Ghoul Investigator.</description>\n<picture>217973.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"2225\" picture=\"192115.jpg\">Kimura Ryouhei</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"76602\" type=\"main character in\" update=\"2018-05-26\">\n<rating votes=\"17\">7.29</rating>\n<name>Arima Kishou</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Arima Kishou is a classmate of http://anidb.net/ch76474 [Taishi], http://anidb.net/ch76471 [Aki] and http://anidb.net/ch76473 [Minami]`s, as well as undercover Ghoul Investigator.

That`s the attitude of high school delinquent, Taishi Fura, who became a loner after falling out with his peers. One day, he witnesses the brutal attack of a ghoul, which left one of his former friends in the hospital and the other dead. Determined to avenge them, Fura decides to pursue the man-eating monster.\nHis efforts allow him to cross paths with Kishou Arima, a quiet student who also attends his high school. Arima, however, is no ordinary student. Despite his young age, he is a full-fledged investigator of the CCG, a government task force that strives to deal with the ghoul threat. Together, Fura and Arima hunt down the ghoul, known as Lantern, but it soon becomes apparent the monster may be closer than anyone suspects.\nIn this side story, Tokyo Ghoul: \"Jack\" offers a glimpse into the past of Kishou Arima, well before he ever became the CCG`s feared God of Death.\nSource: MAL</summary>\n</episode>\n<episode id=\"170106\" update=\"2017-12-21\">\n<epno type=\"1\">2</epno>\n<length>25</length>\n<airdate>2015-12-25</airdate>\n<rating votes=\"4\">5.76</rating>\n<title xml:lang=\"en\">Pinto</title>\n<summary>The OVA adapts the third story in the Tokyo Ghoul: Hibi novel when Shuu Tsukiyama and Chie Hori met.\nSource: MAL</summary>\n</episode>\n</episodes>\n</anime>\n","headers":{"content-encoding":"gzip","date":"Fri, 28 May 2021 18:42:18 GMT","transfer-encoding":"chunked","content-type":"text/xml; charset=utf-8","access-control-allow-origin":"*"},"request":{"uri":{"protocol":"http:","slashes":true,"auth":null,"host":"api.anidb.net:9001","port":"9001","hostname":"api.anidb.net","hash":null,"search":"?request=anime&client=animesynclist&clientver=3&protover=1&aid=11268","query":"request=anime&client=animesynclist&clientver=3&protover=1&aid=11268","pathname":"/httpapi","path":"/httpapi?request=anime&client=animesynclist&clientver=3&protover=1&aid=11268","href":"http://api.anidb.net:9001/httpapi?request=anime&client=animesynclist&clientver=3&protover=1&aid=11268"},"method":"GET","headers":{"accept-encoding":"gzip, deflate"}}}
