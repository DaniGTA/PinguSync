However, a small subset of the Knights supposedly betrayed their homeland and turned their blades against their comrades in an attempt to overthrow the ruler of Liones. They were defeated by the Holy Knights, but rumors continued to persist that these legendary knights, called the \"Seven Deadly Sins,\" were still alive. Ten years later, the Holy Knights themselves staged a coup d’état, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the Kingdom of Liones.\r\n\r\nBased on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins. With their help, she endeavors to not only take back her kingdom from the Holy Knights, but to also seek justice in an unjust world.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","lang":"eng"}],"id":"8699","instanceName":"ListProviderLocalData","canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":"","releaseYear":2014,"runTime":24,"publicScore":9,"rawEntry":{"id":"8699","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/8699"},"genres":[{"id":"8","type":"genres","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/genres/8"},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:18.761Z","updatedAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:18.761Z","name":"Magic","slug":"magic","description":null},{"id":"9","type":"genres","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/genres/9"},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:18.777Z","updatedAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:18.777Z","name":"Supernatural","slug":"supernatural","description":null},{"id":"11","type":"genres","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/genres/11"},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:19.973Z","updatedAt":"2016-01-10T12:27:18.443Z","name":"Fantasy","slug":"fantasy","description":""},{"id":"1","type":"genres","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/genres/1"},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:15.623Z","updatedAt":"2016-07-17T19:30:56.164Z","name":"Action","slug":"action","description":""},{"id":"25","type":"genres","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/genres/25"},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:30.465Z","updatedAt":"2016-10-28T19:41:33.862Z","name":"Ecchi","slug":"ecchi","description":""},{"id":"2","type":"genres","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/genres/2"},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:15.657Z","updatedAt":"2017-04-22T16:11:16.077Z","name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","description":""}],"episodes":[{"id":"149076","type":"episodes","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/episodes/149076"},"relationships":{"media":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/episodes/149076/relationships/media","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/episodes/149076/media"}},"videos":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/episodes/149076/relationships/videos","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/episodes/149076/videos"}}},"createdAt":"2014-10-09T16:07:59.869Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-27T20:44:42.560Z","titles":{"en_jp":"Nanatsu no Taizai","en_us":"The Seven Deadly Sins","ja_jp":"七つの大罪"},"canonicalTitle":"The Seven Deadly Sins","seasonNumber":1,"number":1,"relativeNumber":1,"synopsis":"The third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, Elizabeth, finds Meliodas, who is the owner of the Boar Hat bar and is also one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

However, a small subset of the Knights supposedly betrayed their homeland and turned their blades against their comrades in an attempt to overthrow the ruler of Liones. They were defeated by the Holy Knights, but rumors continued to persist that these legendary knights, called the \"Seven Deadly Sins,\" were still alive. Ten years later, the Holy Knights themselves staged a coup d’état, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the Kingdom of Liones.\r\n\r\nBased on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins. With their help, she endeavors to not only take back her kingdom from the Holy Knights, but to also seek justice in an unjust world.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":100,"titles":{"en":"The Seven Deadly Sins","en_jp":"Nanatsu no Taizai","en_us":"The Seven Deadly Sins","ja_jp":"七つの大罪"},"canonicalTitle":"Nanatsu no Taizai","abbreviatedTitles":["Nanatsu no Taizai"],"averageRating":"83.77","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"3868","3":"103","4":"369","5":"63","6":"412","7":"71","8":"5957","9":"128","10":"1268","11":"212","12":"2421","13":"457","14":"18598","15":"1094","16":"9994","17":"1457","18":"8423","19":"781","20":"60987"},"userCount":167971,"favoritesCount":1651,"startDate":"2014-10-05","endDate":"2015-03-29","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":9,"ratingRank":9,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8699/tiny.jpg?1416279336","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8699/small.jpg?1416279336","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8699/medium.jpg?1416279336","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8699/large.jpg?1416279336","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8699/original.jpg?1416279336","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8699/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8699/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8699/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8699/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":24,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":578,"youtubeVideoId":"wxcvbL6o55M","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":24}}}}
