The http://anidb.net/ch69612 [Commission of Counter Ghoul] is the only organization fighting the http://anidb.net/t7110 [Ghoul] menace, and in order to get the upper hand on their targets, the CCG has instituted a new program where operatives are implanted with kakuho, the Ghoul organ of predation. This http://anidb.net/t7111 [Quinx] procedure has successfully created four young Qs who are being mentored by their predecessor, http://anidb.net/ch92821 [Sasaki Haise]. And while Haise might be the first Quinx, his origins are somewhat mysterious, especially to him. While he knows with certainty that he is Sasaki Haise now, he can`t remember the first two decades of his life and strange voices seem to echo in his mind.\nTo stave off his own inner turmoil, Haise is focused on the difficult task of training his untested charges and meeting the squad goal of surpassing the premier CCG operative, Investigator http://anidb.net/ch98685 [Arima]. And the Quinx Squad not only have to learn to control their Ghoul-like powers, they also have a hell of a lot to prove to the CCG. Many other squads look at the Qs with suspicion or disdain, but Haise and the other Qs are determined to live up to the high expectations placed on them.\nBut while the Qs struggle to figure themselves out and fit in, the Ghouls of http://anidb.net/ch70052 [Aogiri Tree] are increasing their membership and expanding their influence. Every step the CCG takes towards total Ghoul eradication seems to be blocked by smarter, stronger, better-organized Ghouls. And as the war to save humankind heats up, familiar faces from battles past begin to show up.\nSource: Viz Media</description>\n<ratings>\n<permanent count=\"858\">3.48</permanent>\n<temporary count=\"866\">6.03</temporary>\n<review count=\"1\">4.16</review>\n</ratings>\n<picture>221720.jpg</picture>\n<resources>\n<resource type=\"1\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>20173</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"2\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>36511</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"4\">\n<externalentity>\n<url>http://www.marv.jp/special/tokyoghoul/</url>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"6\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>Tokyo_Ghoul</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"7\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>東京喰種トーキョーグール</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"8\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>4863</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"9\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>362082</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"10\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>21034</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"23\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>tkg_anime</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"32\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>B07JHQL5PD</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n</resources>\n<tags>\n<tag id=\"1637\" parentid=\"2565\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-09\">\n<name>reverse trap</name>\n<description>A reverse trap is a plot device where a female character is mistaken for a male, with the intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by the female (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the female, but the occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.\nThis is often achieved by portraying the female character as a male; primarily via their clothing and physical appearance, but also through her behaviour, and/or language. A female character misinterpreted by others as male, without action from the female (explicitly masculine dress or behaviour), is generally not considered a reverse trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561 [androgynous].\nThe reverse case is known as a http://anidb.net/t618 [trap].</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1802\" parentid=\"2606\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2016-01-24\">\n<name>seinen</name>\n<description>Seinen, literally \"young man\", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones.

Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2606\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-05\">\n<name>target audience</name>\n<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-04-29\">\n<name>themes</name>\n<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2608\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-12-04\">\n<name>fetishes</name>\n<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2609\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-01\">\n<name>original work</name>\n<description>What the anime is based on!

It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>\n<picurl>126792.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2636\" parentid=\"2846\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-16\">\n<name>human enhancement</name>\n<description>Human enhancement can take various forms: It can be something comparatively non-intrusive as a power-up drug, a form of machine implantation or cyberization (http://anidb.net/a4414 [SAC Solid State Society]), or outright - possibly atrocious - genetic manipulation (http://anidb.net/a361 [Ao no 6 Gou]).

It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.\nThese terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.\nNovels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.\nContemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.\nIn his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about \"magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels\", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: \"I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales\". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.\nSource: wiki</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2672\" parentid=\"2834\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-03-05\">\n<name>Japan</name>\n<description>Japan is a sovereign island nation in East Asia.

Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).\nIn popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture\nSource: Wiki</description>\n<picurl>68768.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2851\" parentid=\"7050\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-03-11\">\n<name>horror</name>\n<description>The horror cinematic genre is characterized by the attempt to make the viewer experience dread, fear, terror, or horror.

Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term \"splatter cinema\" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.\n[Source: wiki]</description>\n<picurl>32491.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4178\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-05-06\">\n<name>manipulated memories</name>\n<description>The protagonist finds out that his/her cherished memories are actually fake and have been implanted.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4314\" parentid=\"2931\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"false\" update=\"2010-04-11\">\n<name>psychological</name>\n<description>Directed toward dealing with or affecting the mind, especially as a function of awareness, feeling, or motivation.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4537\" parentid=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-02-15\">\n<name>time skip</name>\n<description>The plot features at least one skip or jump in time.\nExample: A skip from the present into the past, or time skips in increments, e.g. every hour there is a time skip by a day.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"4588\" parentid=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2011-05-20\">\n<name>fast-paced</name>\n<description>Hold onto your hats, this anime`s storyline is relentless.\nThe characters don`t get time to take a breath as events keep both them and the viewer on a roller coaster ride of revelation and excitement!\nHopefully it all makes sense...</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"5874\" parentid=\"6233\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2015-02-17\">\n<name>guns are useless</name>\n<description>Guns are about as effective as throwing tissue while only manly things like swords, spears, and bare fists are any use at all.\nIf the weapon shoots a projectile faster than human eyes can track, it is useless.
