A perfect example how great music makes mediocre show an emotional and thrilling adventure. Allthough characters are shallow, story  simple and straight, but good animation, awesome backgrounds and top quality soundtrack more than makes up for it, creating a really entertaining and enjoyable watch. 4/5</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"434072\">Love this show, Let`s hope there will be a 2nd season.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"132520\">not limited to fan servcie, as I initally expected, this show gets pretty intense reaching its 8th chapter. I really didn`t expect much of it at first glance, but now I can honestly say that the plot is pretty well elaborated. the pacing of events is ideal ,\"not too fast, not to slow\" which, I must admit, is a contributing factor for me being glued to the screen</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"279559\">Don`t be deterred by the Hestia-hype. The anime is actually worth watching.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"114373\">it is quite a nice series. The story kinda slow, but good enough to get you hooked to the series. For isekai fan, it is a must see</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"421127\">I love this anime so far. It seems to just keep getting better with each episode.\n\nWhile there is some RPG elements/tropes found in shows like in SAO and others, that`s about where the similarities end. This isn`t about people trapped or adventuring in a video game. To the characters in DanMachi, this is their world and their way of life.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"605168\">I &amp;lt;3 this so much !</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"20352\">Adventures, monsters, and cute girls, oh my! DanMachi resonates so well as an RPG player. There`s an obvious harem pitch but you won`t get overloaded with tons of girls fawning over our adventurous beginner. Character interactions are wonderfully scripted and some things have been changed from the original source. Every sub-plots in this series is an adventure on its own, making DanMachi perhaps the biggest rising star. While everyone has gone goo-goo-ga-ga over Hestia, the supporting female cast are much sweeter. For a more detailed and slightly more gritty version to the series, I recommend picking up the light novel offered by Yen Press.</recommendation>\n<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"260637\">Omg this was so awesome, like really go see it now and pray for a second season.

Adventurers slay those monsters and take their shards, which are then used to craft magic items. To become an adventurer, people join groups called Familia. Each of which is named after and serves a resident deity. The adventurers and their attributes and abilities are ranked by level, improved by experience and supervised by their Familia`s deity.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch70852 [Bell Cranel], a novice adventurer, is the sole member of the Familia under the goddess http://anidb.net/ch70851 [Hestia]. After being saved by top level adventurer http://anidb.net/ch70850 [Ais Wallenstein] of the http://anidb.net/ch73779 [Loki] Familia, he falls in love with her and decides to improve and become worthy of her attention.

It is used widely in visual arts, especially drawing and painting, and can be found in many manga, anime, and video game.\nAnthropomorphic animal characters in the kemono genre are frequently called juujin, \"therianthrope\"; the kanji for juujin are also sometimes pronounced kemonobito, \"beast-human\". While their design differs from artist to artist, they generally employ animal traits considered cute and endearing; most kemono characters retain a fundamentally human personality, however, seldom behaving as the actual animals from which they have been anthropomorphized, and as such they are typically depicted living as humans do.\nJuujin leans more on the human-looking side when compared to http://anidb.net/t2857 [anthropomorphism], which leans more on the animal-looking side.\nSource: Manga Wikia</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1609\" parentid=\"2849\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-03-01\">\n<name>elf</name>\n<description>The origin of Elves (Norse; álfar(elves), álfr(elf)) can be found in ancient Norse mythology, in which, elves are described as divine, or near-divine, race of humanoids (Vættir), likened to the Æsir. In common description they are described as sage and immortal beings occupying the threshold between humans and the gods. In some cases humans that were beloved by the gods became elves within their lives. Ancient Elves are delineated into a pair of similar but distinct races; Light Elves (Ljósálfar) and Dark Elves (Svartálfar), each originating from separate homes within the nine worlds of Yggdrasil. Within the Poetic Edda the differences are commonly ascribed as:\n\"There is one place there that is called the Elf Home (Álfheimr which is the elven city). People live there that are named the light elves (Ljósálfar). But the dark elves (Dökkálfar) live below in earth, in caves and the dark forest and they are unlike them in appearance - and more unlike them in reality. The Light Elves are brighter than the sun in appearance, but the Dark Elves are blacker than pitch.\" (Snorri, Gylfaginning 17, Prose Edda)</description>\n<picurl>63489.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2094\" parentid=\"2849\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2015-10-25\">\n<name>magic</name>\n<description>Magic is the art of purportedly manipulating aspects of reality either by supernatural means or through knowledge of unknown occult laws.</description>\n<picurl>178878.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2355\" parentid=\"2849\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-05-28\">\n<name>dragon</name>\n<description>Very intelligent mythical beings - a cross between a very large lizard and a dinosaur - that breath fire, and have a knack for kidnapping damsels, thus distressing them.

Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-28\">\n<name>dynamic</name>\n<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: \nPlot Continuity \nHow does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-04-29\">\n<name>themes</name>\n<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2608\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-12-04\">\n<name>fetishes</name>\n<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2609\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-01\">\n<name>original work</name>\n<description>What the anime is based on!

This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.\nA world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a \"more than cursory\" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.\nThe fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.\nA fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2647\" parentid=\"2849\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"500\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-05-03\">\n<name>high fantasy</name>\n<description>Generally a serious and epic story set in an invented world.

To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>\n<picurl>161014.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2749\" parentid=\"2604\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-08\">\n<name>nudity</name>\n<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.\nPeople, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.\nThough the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.\nNudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.\nEspecially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.\nSource: wiki</description>\n<picurl>60576.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2750\" parentid=\"2604\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-08\">\n<name>violence</name>\n<description>Violence is the use of physical force against oneself or another entity, compelling action against one`s will on pain of being hurt.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2774\" parentid=\"2094\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-10-08\">\n<name>spellcasting</name>\n<description>The magic version of “call your attacks”.

Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).\nIn popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture\nSource: Wiki</description>\n<picurl>68768.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2850\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"500\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2015-10-25\">\n<name>adventure</name>\n<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, \"jungle\" and \"desert\" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>\n<picurl>178879.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2853\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-02-13\">\n<name>comedy</name>\n<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.\nJapanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>\n<picurl>198104.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2856\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-05\">\n<name>ecchi</name>\n<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes</description>\n<picurl>32416.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2858\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>romance</name>\n<description>Romance describes a story that deals with love between two or more characters typically also having an optimistic ending. Romance is also a difficulty encountered when creating a harem.</description>\n<picurl>210061.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2859\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2016-09-04\">\n<name>harem</name>\n<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a \"http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]\", or sometimes also \"male harem\". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.\nAs a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.\nMost of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called \"harem ending\".</description>\n<picurl>94602.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2879\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-02-27\">\n<name>alcohol</name>\n<description>Alcohol (or more scientifically, ethanol), is one of the world`s oldest psychoactive substances. It is traditionally found in the form of a beverage such as beer, wine, or liquor, although in some contexts it can be inhaled to produce similar or intoxication, and some people prefer another way of consuming beverage-form alcohol.\nAlcoholic beverages are many and varied, due to production methods (fermentation or distillation), source materials (grains, fruits, vegetables, other plants), added substances such as flavorings, and many more ways of defining different forms of alcoholic beverages.\nAlcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.</description>\n<picurl>70749.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2891\" parentid=\"2608\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-12-31\">\n<name>breasts</name>\n<description>The female bust size matters!

However she was disgusted by the attitude of elves towards other races and left the village to reach Ontario a city full of opportunity. In the city she made friends with a female adventure that invited her to join Asteria familia, and also that she would call her Lyon since Lyu was to hard to say.\nLyu reached level 4 and specialised in using wind magic and sword fighting. She has a unique fighting technique that permits her to chant long spells while sword fighting. This style requires an enormous amount of concentration and Makoto even suggested that not even Aiz would be able to replicate such a feat. Her sword is made out of wood of a sacred tree.\nLater Lyon solo survived the destruction of Astrea Familia during an ambush by an enemy famila, she asked her familia goddess to leave Ontario for her protection, however this was only an excuse since she didn`t want her goddess to witnessing her revenge.\nShe took revenge by killing every member of the rival familia and anyone connected with them resulting in the guild offering a bounty on her head.\nAfter her revenge Lyon had no place to go, exhausted and injured was later saved by Syr, which asked her to join her in the staff of the Benevolent Mistress as a waitress. And changed back her name to Lyu.\nLyu sees Syr as her saviour and is totally dedicated in protecting her and helping her in her relationship with Bell.</description>\n<picture>170068.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"2296\" picture=\"189623.jpg\">Hayami Saori</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"73779\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2015-03-14\">\n<rating votes=\"51\">3.62</rating>\n<name>Loki</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>170066.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"28392\" picture=\"224735.jpg\">Kubo Yurika</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"74300\" type=\"secondary cast in\" update=\"2017-06-24\">\n<rating votes=\"35\">5.60</rating>\n<name>Riveria Ljos Alf</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>204167.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"32750\" picture=\"227075.jpg\">Taneda Risa</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"74391\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2015-04-11\">\n<rating votes=\"17\">5.31</rating>\n<name>Anya Flomer</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>171745.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"4616\" picture=\"170439.jpg\">Nishi Asuka</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"74392\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2015-04-11\">\n<rating votes=\"17\">4.93</rating>\n<name>Chloe Roro</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<picture>171746.jpg</picture>\n<seiyuu id=\"34426\" picture=\"128153.jpg\">Suzaki Aya</seiyuu>\n</character>\n<character id=\"74534\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2015-12-07\">\n<rating votes=\"18\">6.43</rating>\n<name>Hephaistos</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>A Goddess who is a friend of Hestia.
