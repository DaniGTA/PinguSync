Sorcerers are like skilled tradesmen who band together in \"guilds\" and take on paying assignments for non-magic wielders, like hunting monsters, retrieving lost items or running odd errands. Lucy is an aspiring wizard who wants to hook up with the coolest guild around, Fairy Tail. One day, she meets a red-headed boy who saves her from a unscrupulous wizard, and before she knows it, she's introduced to the wild and wacky band of wizards of Fairy Tail and begins the adventure of a lifetime.","lastUpdated":1583279594,"airsDayOfWeek":"Sunday","airsTime":"7:00 AM","rating":"TV-14","imdbId":"tt1528406","zap2itId":"","added":"2009-09-20 23:26:59","addedBy":8956,"siteRating":7.9,"siteRatingCount":22613,"slug":"fairy-tail"}},"releaseYear":2009}}}}
