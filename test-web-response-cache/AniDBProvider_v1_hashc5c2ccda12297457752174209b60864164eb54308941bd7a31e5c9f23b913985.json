Such implications include, but are not limited to: repeatedly accompanying the deaths of those dear to them; having to hide their condition from the mortals surrounding them; becoming disillusioned with their lives and being unable to kill themselves; and even staying forever trapped in the body of a specific physical age, that body most often being that of a child.

While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2607","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2009-04-29"},"name":{"_text":"themes"},"description":{"_text":"Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories.

There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.\nIt`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.\nSee also http://anidb.net/t6493 [manhua] and http://anidb.net/t5010 [manhwa]."},"picurl":{"_text":"215593.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2817","parentid":"2856","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2014-09-08"},"name":{"_text":"skimpy clothing"},"description":{"_text":"When a job needs to get done you need the appropriate clothing on the appropriate persons.

Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).\nIn popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture\nSource: Wiki"},"picurl":{"_text":"68768.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2853","parentid":"2611","weight":"200","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2017-02-13"},"name":{"_text":"comedy"},"description":{"_text":"Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results.

When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes"},"picurl":{"_text":"32416.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2858","parentid":"2611","weight":"300","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2017-12-01"},"name":{"_text":"romance"},"description":{"_text":"Romance describes a story that deals with love between two or more characters typically also having an optimistic ending.
