In 2018 the sequel manga Fairy Tail 100 Years Quest was started.\nThe last year saw major changes for certain parties in Earth Land. First, fueled by the tragic death of his foster father http://anidb.net/ch22024 [Igneel] and the constant battles against the http://anidb.net/ch78540 [Dark Guild Tartaros], http://anidb.net/ch11801 [Natsu] left to travel the lands with http://anidb.net/ch11802 [Happy], a renewed determination to become even more powerful lighting his fire.\nEven more surprising was the disbandment of the http://anidb.net/ch18752 [Fairy Tail] guild, a command which came from Fairy Tail Master http://anidb.net/ch12248 [Makarov] himself without any explanation or prior notice.

Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2607","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2009-04-29"},"name":{"_text":"themes"},"description":{"_text":"Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories.

The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations.

Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.\nThough the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.\nNudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.\nEspecially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.\nSource: wiki"},"picurl":{"_text":"60576.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2750","parentid":"2604","weight":"100","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2018-11-08"},"name":{"_text":"violence"},"description":{"_text":"Violence is the use of physical force against oneself or another entity, compelling action against one`s will on pain of being hurt.\nNote: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2773","parentid":"2094","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2015-01-18"},"name":{"_text":"magic circles"},"description":{"_text":"A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic.

In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies).

When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes"},"picurl":{"_text":"32416.jpg"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2857","parentid":"2611","weight":"100","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2019-01-15"},"name":{"_text":"anthropomorphism"},"description":{"_text":"Anthropomorphism is the attribution of uniquely human characteristics to non-human beings, inanimate objects, or natural or supernatural phenomena.

This can be exploited for dramatic effect in war movies, where fatally wounded soldiers wander the battlefield before succumbing.\nSource: TVTropes"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"4342","parentid":"2925","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2014-05-06"},"name":{"_text":"large-scale war"},"description":{"_text":"When the whole world, or, at least, a big part of it, partakes in the hell that is war."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"4394","parentid":"6233","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2014-09-21"},"name":{"_text":"defeat means friendship"},"description":{"_text":"In a series based around an endless series of one-on-one fights, defeating a Worthy Opponent or The Rival will sometimes convert them to the hero`s side, if not always to his cause. \nFurthermore, no matter how many people the Worthy Opponent has killed, how much grief he has caused, even if he slaughtered helpless children or the hero`s own family, as soon as he shows a bit of remorse or goes out of his way to help the hero even once, he will be welcomed into the hero`s circle of True Companions with open arms.\n(Source: TVTropes)"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"4431","parentid":"2858","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2014-04-06"},"name":{"_text":"love at first sight"},"description":{"_text":"Plot device: When two characters meet for the first time, at least one party, supposedly, immediately falls in love with the other party, and from then on tries to get to know that party better."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"4537","parentid":"2605","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2014-02-15"},"name":{"_text":"time skip"},"description":{"_text":"The plot features at least one skip or jump in time.\nExample: A skip from the present into the past, or time skips in increments, e.g. every hour there is a time skip by a day."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"4558","parentid":"2605","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2012-02-12"},"name":{"_text":"long time span"},"description":{"_text":"The anime spans a much longer than usual (for that genre) period of time, typically several years (possibly decades or even centuries).\nExample: In a school setting this could mean the character development is followed from school through college right into working life and the founding of a family with children."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"4572","parentid":"2611","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2013-09-22"},"name":{"_text":"human-animal relationship"},"description":{"_text":"The relationship between a human and an animal (or an animal-like creature like a dragon) plays an important role in the plot of this anime."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"4584","parentid":"2637","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2018-03-13"},"name":{"_text":"time machine"},"description":{"_text":"A machine (or sometimes a living being) that accomplishes time travel.
