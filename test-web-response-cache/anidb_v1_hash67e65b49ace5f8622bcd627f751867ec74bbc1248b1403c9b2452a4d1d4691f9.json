While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation."}},{"_attributes":{"id":"2607","weight":"0","localspoiler":"false","globalspoiler":"false","verified":"true","update":"2009-04-29"},"name":{"_text":"themes"},"description":{"_text":"Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories.

In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies).

Three men - killers of her parents - were in her house, and he killed two of them--one by slitting his throat and the other by charging at with a quickly assembled spear. Mikasa herself killed the third man when he attempted to strangle Eren. After this, he gave Mikasa his scarf and took her into his family.\nLater, when the giants invaded his home, he could only watch on as his mother - trapped under the rubble of their house - was eaten by a giant. This event made him swear that he`d kill every giant and not live a life cowering in fear.\nSometime after this - before the timeskip that jumped a few years ahead, to when he became a soldier - his father injected him with something.

However, in the first four volumes he hasn`t shown any such feelings in return; while he does show hints indicating he cares for her, it is still not known if it is as his sister or as a woman.\nWhen Mikasa`s parents were murdered, and she was tied-up on the floor, Eren saved her life - when visiting by chance with his father - by killing two of the three men who killed her parents, in spite of him only being a child at the time. And then, when the third man was strangling a helpless Eren after catching him off-guard, she picked up a knife off the floor and stabbed the man in the back; killing him.\nAfterward, Eren gave Mikasa his scarf - which, even many years later, she still wears - and made sure she understood that he, and his parents, were now her family.
