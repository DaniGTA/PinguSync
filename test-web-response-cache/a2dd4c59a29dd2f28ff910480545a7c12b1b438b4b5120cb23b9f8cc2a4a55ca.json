If there are any aliens, beings from the future, or super-humans, come see me. That is all!\"\nNaturally, this did raise a few eyebrows, but Haruhi is dead serious. Things get awkward when everyone realises just how serious she is about it all and establishes the SOS Brigade. What makes her quite ominous though is her unimaginable power to actually change the world, but she is totally unaware of her own power and so she is also unaware of the affect of her power on the outside world. The cynical http://anidb.net/ch272 [Kyon], a friend at the SOS Brigade, is among the few who knows of Haruhi`s power, and is desperately trying to keep the world together.\nNote: The chronological order of episodes is: 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, 4, 7, 6, 8, 1, 12, 11, 9.</description>\n<ratings>\n<permanent count=\"15539\">8.11</permanent>\n<temporary count=\"15921\">8.41</temporary>\n<review count=\"26\">8.12</review>\n</ratings>\n<picture>167739.jpg</picture>\n<resources>\n<resource type=\"1\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>6430</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"2\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>849</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"3\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>3508</identifier>\n<identifier>qusbqz</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"4\">\n<externalentity>\n<url>http://www.haruhi.tv/</url>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"6\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya#Anime</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"7\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱_(アニメ)</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"8\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>840</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"9\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>324723</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"10\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>8104</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n<resource type=\"14\">\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>732</identifier>\n<identifier>v</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n<externalentity>\n<identifier>368</identifier>\n<identifier>v</identifier>\n</externalentity>\n</resource>\n</resources>\n<tags>\n<tag id=\"28\" parentid=\"2881\" weight=\"100\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2011-11-16\">\n<name>baseball</name>\n<description>Baseball is like a complicated version of Rounders.

In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.\nSource: Wikipedia</description>\n<picurl>210906.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"362\" parentid=\"2793\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2010-09-24\">\n<name>dancing</name>\n<description>Dance is when people move their body to music.

Although genki characters are usually played exclusively for comedy effect, sometimes they may slow down for a serious or introspective moment.

The term was coined by Sir Richard Burton, and adopted by Duke University psychologist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as telepathy and clairvoyance, and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition. ESP is also sometimes casually referred to as a sixth sense, gut instinct or hunch, which are historical English idioms. The term implies acquisition of information by means external to the basic limiting assumptions of science, such as that organisms can only receive information from the past to the present.\nIn Japanese usage the term is often misappropriated to refer to any supernatural, non-magical, super power. Users of such powers are called `esper` in Japanese. The term `esper` is not normally in use outside of Japan but is slowly being introduced due to its usage in anime and manga.\nIn anime/manga the following powers, among others, are described as ESP:\n- telepathy\n- precognition\n- clairvoyance\n- retrocognition\n- remote viewing\n- aura reading\n- out-of-body experiences (OBE)\n- psychokinesis</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1876\" parentid=\"2794\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2015-02-23\">\n<name>musical band</name>\n<description>A musical ensemble also known as a music(al) group or music(al) band is a group of people who perform instrumental or vocal music, typically known by a distinct name.</description>\n<picurl>10249.jpeg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"1969\" parentid=\"2756\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-03-23\">\n<name>mahjong</name>\n<description>Mahjong is a tile-based game, which was developed in China during the Qing dynasty.

The term originates from http://anidb.net/a22 [Neon Genesis Evangelion] to designate an area of Absolute Terror, although it`s had considerable semantic drift. In this case, it may jokingly refer to the fact it emphasizes a shorter skirt without actually becoming creepy and showing the underpants.\nAs if that wasn`t enough, some even categorize it into five \"Grades\", from E to A. Only the top two (A and B) are considered true Zettai Ryouiki and they are only usable by female characters. Some researchers additionally introduce Grade S, the highest one which consists of Grade A plus further requirements to personality and hairstyle.\nJust to make it clear, Zettai Ryouiki is made up of three components: socks, skin, and skirt. An Action Girl may trade the latter for hotpants but if it doesn`t include knee-highs and thighs, it`s not Zettai Ryouiki. Panty Shot is an entirely different zone.\nFor more information on sock lengths in general, see also: http://anidb.net/t6419 [hosiery]\nSource: TV Tropes</description>\n<picurl>165582.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-28\">\n<name>dynamic</name>\n<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: \nPlot Continuity \nHow does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2606\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-11-05\">\n<name>target audience</name>\n<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2009-04-29\">\n<name>themes</name>\n<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2608\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2012-12-04\">\n<name>fetishes</name>\n<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2609\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-09-01\">\n<name>original work</name>\n<description>What the anime is based on!

It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>\n<picurl>126792.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2637\" parentid=\"7050\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>time travel</name>\n<description>In time travel anime characters are transported through time either figuratively or literally to find themselves either in the past or the future</description>\n<picurl>210068.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2648\" parentid=\"2849\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-11-04\">\n<name>contemporary fantasy</name>\n<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.\nThese terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.\nNovels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.\nContemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.\nIn his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about \"magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels\", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: \"I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales\". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.\nSource: wiki</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2655\" parentid=\"2853\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2005-05-09\">\n<name>parody</name>\n<description>Anime that imitate other stories (can be from TV, film, books, historical events, ...) for comic effect by exaggerating the style and changing the content of the original.

Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).\nIn popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture\nSource: Wiki</description>\n<picurl>68768.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2853\" parentid=\"2611\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"400\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-02-13\">\n<name>comedy</name>\n<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results.

When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\nSource: TV Tropes</description>\n<picurl>32416.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2858\" parentid=\"2611\" weight=\"200\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>romance</name>\n<description>Romance describes a story that deals with love between two or more characters typically also having an optimistic ending.

Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a \"http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]\", or sometimes also \"male harem\". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.\nAs a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.\nMost of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called \"harem ending\".</description>\n<picurl>94602.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2862\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"300\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2018-01-21\">\n<name>friendship</name>\n<description>The feeling of trust, kindness, and friendship between a group of high school students for example, is a central theme of this anime.</description>\n<picurl>65691.png</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"2869\" parentid=\"2607\" infobox=\"true\" weight=\"600\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2017-12-01\">\n<name>school life</name>\n<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school.

A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.\nThis is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.\nIn many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.\nSource: TVTRope</description>\n<picurl>169641.jpg</picurl>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"3683\" parentid=\"2605\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-28\">\n<name>storytelling</name>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"3758\" parentid=\"6148\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2016-01-28\">\n<name>concert</name>\n<description>The main characters play one or more live music performances during the show.

Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.\nIn some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to \"finish\", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.\nAn incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"6023\" parentid=\"6148\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2015-06-01\">\n<name>cosplay restaurant</name>\n<description>Cosplay restaurants are theme restaurants and pubs that originated in Akihabara, Tokyo, Japan around the year 1999. They include maid cafés and butler cafés, where the service staff dress as elegant maids, or as butlers. Such restaurants and cafés have quickly become a staple of Japanese otaku culture. Compared with service at normal cafés, the service at cosplay cafés involves the creation of a rather different atmosphere. The staff treat the customers as masters and mistresses in a private home rather than merely as café customers.\nThe popularity of the cosplay restaurants and maid cafés has spread to other regions in Japan, such as Osaka`s Den Den Town as well as other countries, such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Mexico, and Canada.\nOften such cafés or a more simple kissaten, small Japanese-style coffee shops, are part of school festivals where the protagonists` class runs one.</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"6086\" parentid=\"2607\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-17\">\n<name>the power of love</name>\n<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.\nMore so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.\nEven when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was \"really responsible\".</description>\n</tag>\n<tag id=\"6148\" parentid=\"30\" weight=\"0\" localspoiler=\"false\" globalspoiler=\"false\" verified=\"true\" update=\"2014-09-10\">\n<name>TO BE MOVED TO EPISODE</name>\n<description>Tags under this parent tag are going to be moved to episode tags and removed from the anime they`re currently assigned to.

Though Lina appreciated the offer, she initially opted against accepting Gourry as a bodyguard, but Gourry`s big-brotherly nature prevented him from acting otherwise. Gourry, dense as a brick, saw Lina as a younger girl in need of protection, and thus, he offered it.\nGourry is the owner of the most powerful sword known to man, the mysterious Sword of Light. The Sword of Light channels its users intentions into energy, usually taking the form of a gleaming blade of light. Gourry has learned how to utilize the sword`s energy in different forms, though, most notably the power of swinging it quickly downwards to form energy beam projectiles.\nGourry is the swordsman of the group, and acts the role very well. He`s single-minded in his protection of Lina, and even after helping Lina defeat Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu, he has resolved to follow Lina around wherever she goes. Supposedly, he has nothing better to do, and perhaps still sees himself as her guardian.</description>\n<picture>26399.jpg</picture>\n</character>\n<character id=\"7618\" type=\"cameo appearance in\" update=\"2009-05-29\">\n<rating votes=\"293\">7.70</rating>\n<name>Zelgadis Greywords</name>\n<gender>male</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>When Lina Inverse overthrew the Dragon`s Fang bandit gang, one of Zelgadiss` men, Zolf, happened to be stuck inside. And, well, he got incinerated. Needless to say, Zelgadiss was mad. More importantly, though, Lina had gotten a very valuable Orihalcon statue, which was the reason Zolf was there to begin with. Zelgadiss wanted the statue in hopes that it could cure his chimaeric curse.\nOnly, it didn`t quite work out that way. Zelgadiss didn`t quite cure himself, even after the whole incident with Rezo, the Red Priest and Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu. So, he`s still searching for a cure, hoping to find one of the fabled Clair-Bibles in hopes to cure himself. The curse makes him 1/3 golem, 1/3 demon, and 1/3 human, which makes him impervious to most physical weapon such as swords and buckshot, but not to the physical impact of, say, a cannonball.\nZelgadiss is quite self-conscious about his appearance, almost ashamed of it. In fact, he`s a very quiet character all around, only speaking when necessary, and only interested in the shortest path to his cure. He also tends to get embarassed easily wherever the topic of romance is brought up.\nZelgadiss is a superb swordsman, having trained many long years. He often enhances his blade with the Astral Vine spell, one of many Shamanist spells at his disposal. He has more or less mastered the Spirit category of Shamanism, having learned its most powerful spell, the Ra-Tilt, among numerous other spells in other categories.</description>\n<picture>26411.jpg</picture>\n</character>\n<character id=\"7619\" type=\"cameo appearance in\" update=\"2015-02-24\">\n<rating votes=\"293\">6.53</rating>\n<name>Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Amelia is the daughter of Philionel el de Seyruun, Crown Prince of the kingdom of Seyruun. Like her father, Amelia is a self-proclaimed Champion of Justice(tm) and is singleminded in her quest for truth, honor, and dignity. Also like her father, she`s a complete klutz and has no clue of what IS and ISN`T a true cause for justice.\nAmelia has trained since birth for her cause; once convinced, she isn`t easily dissuaded from inflicting her particular flavor of justice on whoever she perceives to be an \"enemy of the people\". She thinks of Lina as a hero - a destructive hero, but nevertheless a hero - and wants to be just like her and every other good hero that comes along.\nAmelia gets bored being royalty sometimes - she often follows her father Phil on journeys around the countryside. She often looks for trouble, simply so that she can right it. Whenever scouting out an area, she always includes a quick look for the highest place to stand.\n...\nWhy does she always look for the highest place to stand, you ask? In case the enemy strikes, she wants to be able to strike back with a dynamic, triumphant pose of her own, terrifying the enemy with fear of justice. A lot of times, she ends up falling, too, she`s only a young girl after all. In fact, Amelia has the reputation of being one of the clumsiest characters in all of Slayers, topped only by Martina.\nAmelia is also a budding sorcerer in her own right. Her specialty is white magic, however she also has reached the highest level of training in Shamanist Spirit magic, a testament to her quick learning time and eagerness to learn. She has even developed a spell or two of her own, most notably the Visfarank spell, which seems to be the glowing manifestation of justice as a pair of boxing gloves.</description>\n<picture>169335.jpg</picture>\n</character>\n<character id=\"7725\" type=\"cameo appearance in\" update=\"2014-09-18\">\n<rating votes=\"341\">7.81</rating>\n<name>Gracia Ul Naga Seyruun</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>Naga the White Serpent is the self-proclaimed rival and companion of Lina Inverse.\nNaga`s real full name is Gracia Ul Naga Seyruun, making her the first daughter of Crown Prince Philionel El Di Seyruun and the older sister of Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun.\nNaga is very skilled in white magic, no doubt because of where she grew up. Lina is often surprised when Naga uses these spells, because Naga does not seem like the kind of person to want to heal people. Naga also specializes in shamanistic magic, especially spells of the earth and water variety. She enjoys creating her own golems (even if they usually don`t turn out very well), and one of her favorite spells to use is Freeze Arrow.\nNaga is also able to terrorize people with her obnoxious laughing. She`s extremely proud of her highly developed, self-confident laugh and the effect that it has on unsuspecting people. She also likes to use her body to tease or distract men who are trying to go against her.\nNaga carries a large sword, but she is never seen using it, possibly because she is afraid of blood. This phobia was most likely caused by witnessing her mother`s brutal slaughter. The mere sight of blood, even from a small cut, is enough to cause her to faint.</description>\n<picture>161192.jpg</picture>\n</character>\n<character id=\"8633\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2009-06-06\">\n<rating votes=\"105\">6.60</rating>\n<name>Asahina Mikuru</name>\n<gender>female</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"1\">Character</charactertype>\n<description>An older, adult Mikuru from farther into the future traveled back in time to give Kyon some critical information regarding future events relative to his time span.\nHowever, like her younger time-variant, she was still unable to go into much detail and was only able to provide short, rather vague pieces of information.

She carries a typically emotionless expression, is fanatic about dango (Japanese dumpling) and can do almost anything for the sake of dango.\nFerris is incredibly skilled in the sword and assigned by Sion to guard Ryner on his quest to search for the \"relics of heroes\". She enjoys teasing and bullying Ryner, and unconsciously gradually develops feelings for him, going into tears then into a berserk rage when she believed Ryner to be dead, attacking an opponent far superior to her with no second thoughts others than vengeance and no thought of her own well being. Her sword possesses the \"ability to devour gods\", which has the power to cut off the demon within Ryner, but with the price being her own life upon invocation.\nShe was abused as a child due her family practicing the dark tradition of incest to keep its bloodline pure. Ferris was originally suppose to marry her brother however Both Ferris and her sister were considered to be unworthy of preserving the Eris bloodline by her parents and would have been killed were not for her brother`s murdering of their parents to save Ferris`s life and forever ending the Eris`s family dark legacy.</description>\n<picture>48385.jpg</picture>\n</character>\n<character id=\"82293\" type=\"appears in\" update=\"2016-09-04\">\n<rating votes=\"5\">4.71</rating>\n<name>ENOZ</name>\n<gender>none/does not apply</gender>\n<charactertype id=\"3\">Organization</charactertype>\n<description>An all girl student band called ENOZ.
