**PinguSync** is for syncing animelists like **watching**, **completed** between various sites.

Example: You mark a Series as watched on **AniList** and **PinguSync** will sync that mark to **Kitsu**.
Now you have that series marked as watched on **Kitsu** and **AniList**.

## Sites that currently will be Supported

Providers that only have login support will become late the list sync support.

> **For Devolopers:**
> All provider for list syncing need to follow the interface **ListProvider** (list-provider.ts)
> All Provider API's are stored in the folder:

    src/backend/api/information-providers
