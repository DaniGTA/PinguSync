When it gets dark, they attack innocent citizens and feed on their flesh. Externally, they are indistinguishable from their fellow human beings. And worse: they live in the middle of us! Who knows, maybe the nice girl from the café or the neighbor next door has a little weakness for human flesh ?! So it's no wonder that bookworm and freshman Ken lands in the middle of a ghula's arms.

self-absorbed mage in a world of wands, cloaks, and royalty. Although she studies at Tristain Academy, a prestigious school for magicians, she has a major problem: Louise is unable to cast magic properly, earning her the nickname of \"Louise the Zero\" from her classmates.\r\nWhen the first year students are required to perform a summoning ritual, Louise's summoning results in a catastrophic explosion!

When he was on his way home he witnessed a shocking view as the world suddenly froze: people were engulfed by blue flames and a monster resembling a large doll swallowed them. Just as the monster prepared to consume Yuuji, a sword-wielding girl in black attire with flaming red eyes and hair that burns like embers saved him from the monster.

He begins to realize the gravity of his mission, and his dream of coexistence between mankind and the seraphim becomes more intense—\r\n\r\nAnd thus, the Shepherd embarks on an amazing journey with his companions.","lastUpdated":1563615282,"airsDayOfWeek":"Sunday","airsTime":"23:00","rating":"TV-14","imdbId":"tt5861670","zap2itId":"","added":"2016-04-30 09:27:57","addedBy":456663,"siteRating":7.2,"siteRatingCount":12,"slug":"tales-of-zestiria-the-x"}},"publicScore":7.2}],"packageId":"","id":"TV14aKQuFwehVq9w5X4ZlM62qr3ktF","lastUpdate":1568138598358,"lastInfoUpdate":1568139583898,"seasonDetectionType":"Provider: Trakt","canSync":true,"cachedSeason":1},{"listProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":45546,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"Trakt","lastUpdate":"2019-09-10T18:03:18.358Z","lastExternalChange":"2018-03-31T18:53:02.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"K","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"k","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":"","rawEntry":{"plays":26,"last_watched_at":"2018-03-31T18:53:02.000Z","last_updated_at":"2018-03-31T19:32:25.000Z","reset_at":null,"show":{"title":"K","year":2012,"ids":{"trakt":45546,"slug":"k","tvdb":261249,"imdb":"tt2377452","tmdb":45799,"tvrage":null}},"seasons":[{"number":2,"episodes":[{"number":1,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":2,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":3,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":4,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":5,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":6,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":7,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":8,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":9,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":10,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":11,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":12,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":13,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2018-03-31T18:53:02.000Z"}]},{"number":1,"episodes":[{"number":1,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":2,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":3,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":4,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":5,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":6,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":7,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":8,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":9,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":10,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":11,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":12,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"number":13,"plays":1,"last_watched_at":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"}]}]},"watchProgress":[{"episode":1,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":2,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":3,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":4,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":5,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":6,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":7,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":8,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":9,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":10,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":11,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":12,"playCount":1,"played":"2017-10-02T21:25:08.000Z"},{"episode":13,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-03-31T18:53:02.000Z"}],"targetSeason":2,"watchStatus":2}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":5192,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-10T18:19:47.260Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/21/54664.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/21/54664.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"K","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>Set in a world where history has taken a slightly different course from the one we're familiar with, K follows the story of a young boy whose life is caught in a psychic war between seven kings.</p><p>Ashinaka High School is known for its unique setting: the entire campus is built on an island.

The diclonius have horns and strong telekinetic powers represented by \"vectors\". However with this great power, they can easily destroy the human race. Fearful of their power, humans quarantined the diclonius into secret research facilities to study. However, in a freak accident, a enraged female diclonius escaped, killing many guards in the process. While escaping, she is shot in the head, and falls into the ocean. As a result she has waves of amnesia. Later, she washes ashore. There, she meets two people named Kouta and Yuka, who name the female diclonius \"Nyuu\", after the only word she can say. They decide to watch after her, but of course, the research facility can't have this, and begin trying to retrieve her by any means

Humanity has been pushed to the brink of extinction following the emergence of man-eating monsters called \"Aragami\" that boast an immunity to conventional weaponry.

self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in Akihabara, where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective \"future gadgets\" with fellow lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed \"Daru.\" The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the \"Phone Microwave,\" which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.\r\n\r\nThough miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the

There, the group also meets Tsumugu Kihara, a fellow student and fisherman who loves the sea.\r\nHikari and his friends' lives are bound to change as they have to deal with the deep-seated hatred and discrimination between the people of sea and of the surface, the storms in their personal lives, as well as an impending tempest which may spell doom for all who dwell on the surface.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":90,"titles":{"en":"A Lull in the Sea","en_jp":"Nagi no Asukara","en_us":"A Lull in the Sea","ja_jp":"凪のあすから"},"canonicalTitle":"Nagi no Asukara","abbreviatedTitles":["Nagi no Asu Kara","Earth color of a calm","Nagiasu"],"averageRating":"80.86","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"136","3":"0","4":"75","5":"3","6":"113","7":"1","8":"388","9":"13","10":"397","11":"15","12":"908","13":"32","14":"2023","15":"92","16":"2809","17":"114","18":"2709","19":"53","20":"3573"},"userCount":32844,"favoritesCount":988,"startDate":"2013-10-03","endDate":"2014-04-03","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":183,"ratingRank":466,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7370/tiny.jpg?1436734819","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7370/small.jpg?1436734819","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7370/medium.jpg?1436734819","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7370/large.jpg?1436734819","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7370/original.png?1436734819","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7370/tiny.jpg?1519183389","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7370/small.jpg?1519183389","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7370/large.jpg?1519183389","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7370/original.jpg?1519183389","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":26,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":598,"youtubeVideoId":"rukiDx9hYDM","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":26}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"9387","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-10T18:22:59.725Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"A Lull in the Sea","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Earth color of a calm","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Nagi no Asukara","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"nagiasu","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"來自風平浪靜的明日","lang":"zh-Hant","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"凪のあすから","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"来自风平浪静的明天","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"unkown"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":17959,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-10T18:22:59.794Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/60/151834.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/60/151834.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Nagi no Asukara","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>Long ago, all humans lived in the ocean.

Thus, the pair is forced into an uneasy coexistence and must defend themselves from hostile parasites that hope to eradicate this new threat to their species.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":27,"titles":{"en":"Parasyte -the maxim-","en_jp":"Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu","en_us":"Parasyte -the maxim-","ja_jp":"寄生獣 セイの格率"},"canonicalTitle":"Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu","abbreviatedTitles":["Parasite","Parasitic Beasts","Parasyte"],"averageRating":"83.26","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"1228","3":"11","4":"128","5":"16","6":"121","7":"24","8":"1686","9":"37","10":"581","11":"47","12":"1698","13":"155","14":"7170","15":"435","16":"8067","17":"788","18":"8197","19":"426","20":"18939"},"userCount":83786,"favoritesCount":1679,"startDate":"2014-10-09","endDate":"2015-03-26","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":33,"ratingRank":48,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"Violence, Profanity","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8147/tiny.jpg?1513365783","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8147/small.jpg?1513365783","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8147/medium.jpg?1513365783","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8147/large.jpg?1513365783","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8147/original.jpg?1513365783","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554},"large":{"width":550,"height":780}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8147/tiny.jpg?1519181075","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8147/small.jpg?1519181075","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8147/large.jpg?1519181075","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8147/original.jpg?1519181075","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":24,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":null,"youtubeVideoId":"9Oe9umzw1Gc","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":24}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"10272","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-10T18:23:39.196Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Il Parassita","lang":"it","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Kiseijuu","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"L`ospite indesiderato","lang":"it","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Parasite","lang":"fr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Parasyte","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Parasyte -the maxim-","lang":"es","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Parasyte: The Maxim","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Parazit: Mravní zásady života","lang":"cs","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Паразит","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Паразит: Жизненный принцип","lang":"ru","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Паразит: Основно правило","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"기생수","lang":"ko","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"寄生兽 生命的准则","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"寄生獣 セイの格率","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":1964,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-10T18:23:39.316Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/11/27917.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/11/27917.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Kiseijuu","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>One day, high school boy Shinichi wakes up to find that his hand has been possesses by a talking alien parasite Although he and his parasite are able to form a reluctant symbiotic relationship of sorts, the other parasites on Earth have taken over their hosts' bodies completely.

double dollar bounty on his head which has made it difficult for him to go anywhere without being chased and shot at. Every town he ever visits ends up being destroyed because of his pursuers, but miraculously no one ever gets killed. Meryl and Milly are two insurance agents that have been sent to find Vash the Stampede and keep him under surveillance so no more damage is caused. Meryl, who leads the pair, refuses to believe that the man they have met can possibly be the legendary gunman. This spikey haired, gangly, young man is extremely friendly, a pacifist, hates blood and suicide, absolutely loves donuts, and is a dork and a crybaby (far from a notorious outlaw).

Things aren't looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.\r\n\r\nHowever, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.","lastUpdated":1562010759,"airsDayOfWeek":"Monday","airsTime":"1:00 AM","rating":"TV-MA","imdbId":"tt5607616","zap2itId":"","added":"2015-12-29

As with every other school he has ever attended, he finds it difficult to make friends there because of his naturally-blond hair (inherited from his deceased English mother) and fierce-looking eyes, which make him look like a dangerous \"yankee\" to his prejudiced schoolmates.\r\n\r\nOne day, Kodaka accidentally comes across the equally solitary and very abrasive Yozora Mikazuki while she converses with her imaginary friend Tomo. Realizing that neither of them have any social lives, they decide that the best way to improve their situation is to form a club – the Neighbor's Club – precisely intended to make friends and learn social skills.","lastUpdated":1565775377,"airsDayOfWeek":"","airsTime":"","rating":"TV-MA","imdbId":"tt2645500","zap2itId":"","added":"2011-09-15

To reach their goal, they have to cross pathways with several powerful teams, some of which have one of the five players with godlike abilities, whom Kuroko and Taiga make a pact to defeat.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":-7,"titles":{"en":"Kuroko's Basketball","en_jp":"Kuroko no Basket","en_us":"Kuroko's Basketball","ja_jp":"黒子のバスケ"},"canonicalTitle":"Kuroko no Basket","abbreviatedTitles":["Kuroko no Basuke","KuroBas"],"averageRating":"83.02","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"562","3":"7","4":"70","5":"17","6":"72","7":"5","8":"619","9":"18","10":"425","11":"31","12":"1150","13":"85","14":"4117","15":"204","16":"5467","17":"308","18":"4215","19":"126","20":"9775"},"userCount":49538,"favoritesCount":1436,"startDate":"2012-04-08","endDate":"2012-09-22","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":101,"ratingRank":78,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6595/tiny.jpg?1408458846","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6595/small.jpg?1408458846","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6595/medium.jpg?1408458846","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6595/large.jpg?1408458846","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6595/original.jpg?1408458846","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6595/tiny.jpg?1519181078","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6595/small.jpg?1519181078","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6595/large.jpg?1519181078","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6595/original.jpg?1519181078","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":25,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":600,"youtubeVideoId":"FTUIs_SuQfw","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":25}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"8681","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-10T18:24:52.908Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Kurobas","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Kuroko no Baske","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Kuroko no Basket","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"kuroko no basket","lang":"fr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Kuroko no Basuke","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Kuroko`s Basketball","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"The Basketball Which Kuroko Plays","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"THE BASKETBALL WHICH KUROKO PLAYS.","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Баскетбол Куроко","lang":"ru","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Баскетболът на Куроко","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"幻影籃球王","lang":"zh-Hant","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"影子籃球員","lang":"zh","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"黑子的篮球","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"黒バス","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"黒子のバスケ","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":6873,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-10T18:24:53.013Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/25/64851.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/25/64851.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Kuroko no Basuke","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>The Teiko Middle School Basketball Team.
