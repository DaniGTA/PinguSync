Along with his friend Sunohara, he skips school and plans to waste his high school days away.\r\nOne day while walking to school, Tomoya passes a young girl muttering quietly to herself.  Without warning she exclaims \"Anpan!\" (a popular Japanese food) which catches Tomoya's attention. He soon discovers the girl's name is Nagisa Furukawa and that she exclaims things she likes in order to motivate herself. Nagisa claims they are now friends, but Tomoya walks away passing the encounter off as nothing.\r\nHowever, Tomoya finds he is noticing Nagisa more and more around school.

Peak Academy is an elite high school that accepts only the most talented students. Individuals who successfully enroll receive their own unique titles, suitably reflective of their skills and traits. Of the fifteen candidates admitted to the peculiar school that year, Makoto Naegi is a completely ordinary individual who has been accepted by sheer chance, with the title of \"Super High School-Level Luck.\"\r\nNaegi and his fellow classmates are initially ecstatic to be chosen to study at this prestigious institution, but these feelings of happiness are short-lived.

When she's not attending her first year of high school, she even invents new flavors and varieties for Tama-ya, her family's mochi shop. School and growing up, on the other hand, are some things that she's still trying to find the right recipe for. But with the help of her best friends Kanna and Midori, two girls whose parents run businesses in the same shopping district, Tamako's determined to make the best of things.

the introduction of strict new morality laws, Japan has become a nation cleansed of all that is obscene and impure.

But as he becomes more and more involved in his little sister's secret life, it becomes that much harder to keep under wraps. \r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":40,"titles":{"en":"Oreimo","en_jp":"Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai","ja_jp":"俺の妹がこんなに可愛いわけがない"},"canonicalTitle":"Oreimo","abbreviatedTitles":["My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute"],"averageRating":"72.78","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"370","3":"6","4":"320","5":"6","6":"353","7":"13","8":"1113","9":"25","10":"1398","11":"28","12":"3146","13":"82","14":"5521","15":"97","16":"6051","17":"43","18":"2442","19":"17","20":"3157"},"userCount":41240,"favoritesCount":498,"startDate":"2010-10-03","endDate":"2010-12-19","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":129,"ratingRank":2418,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5487/tiny.jpg?1433468501","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5487/small.jpg?1433468501","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5487/medium.jpg?1433468501","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5487/large.jpg?1433468501","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5487/original.png?1433468501","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5487/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5487/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5487/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5487/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":12,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":288,"youtubeVideoId":"f_2F7u2-6yc","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":12}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"7525","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:06:37.253Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Mijn Zusje kan Onmogelijk zo Schattig zijn","lang":"nl","nameType":"official"},{"name":"My Little Sister Can`t Be This Cute","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Ore no Imoto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai (saison 1)","lang":"fr","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"main"},{"name":"Oreimo","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"oreimo","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"short"},{"name":"oreimo1","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"short"},{"name":"Не може моя сестра бути такою милою","lang":"uk","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Ну не может сестренка быть такой милой","lang":"ru","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Няма как по-малката ми сестра да е такава сладурана","lang":"bg","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"내 여동생이 이렇게 귀여울 리가 없어","lang":"ko","nameType":"official"},{"name":"おれいも","lang":"ja","nameType":"short"},{"name":"俺の妹がこんなに可愛いわけがない","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"},{"name":"俺妹","lang":"ja","nameType":"short"},{"name":"我的妹妹哪有这么可爱!","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"official"},{"name":"我的妹妹哪有這麼可愛!","lang":"zh-Hant","nameType":"official"},{"name":"我的妹妹才不会这么可爱","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"syn"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":5667,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:06:37.313Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/22/56879.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/22/56879.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>For several years, Kyousuke's relationship with his younger sister Kirino has been cold, to the point that they only share greetings.

ready.\" – Aria Kanzaki\r\nIn the world of Hidan no Aria AA, there are special students called Butei who are authorized to carry weapons, investigate crimes and solve various incidents. One of the best of these students is an S-rank second year at Tokyo Butei High School named Aria Kanzaki. On the opposite end of the scale is E-rank first year named Akari Mamiya.\r\nAkari absolutely idolizes Aria and wants to become an elite Butei just like her but sadly she just isn't very good and constantly fails her rank exams.

However, before Yuuji can learn anything more about his situation, he discovers that he has already been reduced to a Torch—merely a scrap of memory waiting to be extinguished.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":95,"titles":{"en":"Shakugan no Shana: Season I","en_jp":"Shakugan no Shana","en_us":"Shakugan no Shana: Season I","ja_jp":"灼眼のシャナ"},"canonicalTitle":"Shakugan no Shana","abbreviatedTitles":["Burning-Eyed Shana"],"averageRating":"74.83","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"71","3":"0","4":"102","5":"1","6":"166","7":"0","8":"516","9":"15","10":"761","11":"14","12":"1725","13":"27","14":"3003","15":"49","16":"3470","17":"25","18":"1549","19":"4","20":"1990"},"userCount":29199,"favoritesCount":360,"startDate":"2005-10-06","endDate":"2006-03-23","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":234,"ratingRank":1623,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/322/tiny.jpg?1408441215","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/322/small.jpg?1408441215","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/322/medium.jpg?1408441215","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/322/large.jpg?1408441215","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/322/original.jpg?1408441215","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/322/tiny.jpg?1519179967","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/322/small.jpg?1519179967","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/322/large.jpg?1519179967","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/322/original.jpg?1519179967","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":24,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":576,"youtubeVideoId":"9C2nhALMzrk","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":24}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"3408","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:00:16.475Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Burning Eyes Shana","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Ognistooka Shana","lang":"pl","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Shakugan no Shana","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Shakugan no Shana 1","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Shana de los Ojos Ardientes","lang":"es","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Shana dels Ulls Ardents","lang":"ca","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Shana dos Olhos Ardentes","lang":"pt-BR","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"SHANA Liepsnojančios Akys","lang":"lt","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Shana of the Burning Eyes","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Shana1","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"short"},{"name":"SnS 1","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Вогняноока Шана","lang":"uk","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Жгучий взор Сяны","lang":"ru","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Огнеглазая Шана","lang":"ru","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Огнеокая Сяна","lang":"ru","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Шана с горящите очи","lang":"bg","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"شانا","lang":"ar","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"เนตรเพลิงชานะ","lang":"th","nameType":"official"},{"name":"작안의 샤나","lang":"ko","nameType":"official"},{"name":"灼眼のシャナ","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"},{"name":"灼眼的夏娜","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"syn"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":10489,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:00:16.597Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/35/88637.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/35/88637.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Shakugan no Shana","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>Sakai Yuuji, a high school student who expected his normal life to last forever, is dead.

The girl called herself a \"Flame Haze\" who hunts the \"Guze no Tomogara\", creatures from another world. As Yuuji noticed a blue flame in his chest, she called him a \"Torch\", a temporary replacement, saying that the \"real\" Yuuji's existence had already ended. Unfazed, Yuuji befriended the strange girl, named her \"Shana\", and joined her fight against Tomogara and other Flame Hazes.","lang":"en"}],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""}],"packageId":"","id":"PEY8ncbXlpju3XjIhdJ7wezeYRRWpN","lastUpdate":1568457430072,"lastInfoUpdate":1568401409094,"seasonDetectionType":"Name","canSync":false,"cachedSeason":3},{"listProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":118263,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"Trakt","lastUpdate":"2019-09-14T10:37:10.072Z","lastExternalChange":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Gamers!","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"gamers-2017","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"}],"overviews":[{"lang":"eng"}],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":"","releaseYear":2017,"rawEntry":{"title":"Gamers!","year":2017,"ids":{"trakt":118263,"slug":"gamers-2017","tvdb":327007,"imdb":"tt7163698","tmdb":72426,"tvrage":null}},"watchProgress":[{"episode":1,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":2,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":3,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":4,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":5,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":6,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":7,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":8,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":9,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":10,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":11,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"},{"episode":12,"playCount":1,"played":"2018-04-04T12:59:56.000Z"}],"targetSeason":1,"watchStatus":2},{"version":1,"id":97766,"fullInfo":true,"provider":"AniList","lastUpdate":"2019-09-14T10:37:08.287Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/nx97766-i2Qykv0cTKNq.jpg","size":2},{"url":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/nx97766-i2Qykv0cTKNq.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[{"url":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/97766-lgzaojRYIWSR.jpg","size":2}],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Gamers!","lang":"x-jap","nameType":"official"},{"name":"GAMERS!","lang":"unknown","nameType":"main"},{"name":"ゲーマーズ!","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":"","releaseYear":2017,"score":34,"episodes":12,"rawEntry":{"id":20733188,"score":0,"scoreRaw":0,"progress":12,"progressVolumes":null,"repeat":0,"private":false,"priority":0,"notes":null,"hiddenFromStatusLists":false,"startedAt":{"year":null,"month":null,"day":null},"completedAt":{"year":2018,"month":3,"day":2},"updatedAt":1527556828,"createdAt":1519941840,"media":{"id":97766,"title":{"romaji":"Gamers!","english":"GAMERS!","native":"ゲーマーズ!","userPreferred":"Gamers!"},"format":"TV","type":"ANIME","status":"FINISHED","episodes":12,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"ADAPTATION"},{"relationType":"ALTERNATIVE"}],"nodes":[{"id":94309},{"id":98786}]},"startDate":{"year":2017,"month":7,"day":13},"endDate":{"year":2017,"month":9,"day":28},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/97766-lgzaojRYIWSR.jpg","coverImage":{"large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/nx97766-i2Qykv0cTKNq.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/nx97766-i2Qykv0cTKNq.jpg"}}},"targetSeason":1,"watchProgress":[{"episode":1,"playCount":1},{"episode":2,"playCount":1},{"episode":3,"playCount":1},{"episode":4,"playCount":1},{"episode":5,"playCount":1},{"episode":6,"playCount":1},{"episode":7,"playCount":1},{"episode":8,"playCount":1},{"episode":9,"playCount":1},{"episode":10,"playCount":1},{"episode":11,"playCount":1},{"episode":12,"playCount":1}],"watchStatus":2},{"version":1,"id":"12754","fullInfo":false,"provider":"Kitsu","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:10:20.982Z","lastExternalChange":"2019-09-13T18:00:04.622Z","covers":[{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12754/original.jpg?1499227201","size":1},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12754/tiny.jpg?1499227201","size":5},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12754/small.jpg?1499227201","size":4},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/12754/large.jpg?1499227201","size":2}],"banners":[{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/12754/original.png?1519183786","size":1},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/12754/tiny.jpg?1519183786","size":5},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/12754/small.jpg?1519183786","size":4},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/12754/large.jpg?1519183786","size":2}],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Gamers!","lang":"en_us","nameType":"official"},{

But if they fail, they face the consequence of participating in a devastating war that will engulf both sides of the gate.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":150,"titles":{"en":"GATE","en_jp":"Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri","en_us":"GATE","ja_jp":"GATE（ゲート）自衛隊　彼の地にて、斯く戦えり"},"canonicalTitle":"Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri","abbreviatedTitles":["Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There!"],"averageRating":"77.95","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"107","3":"1","4":"134","5":"6","6":"205","7":"7","8":"476","9":"14","10":"618","11":"27","12":"1293","13":"79","14":"3299","15":"154","16":"4098","17":"157","18":"2575","19":"46","20":"3165"},"userCount":32056,"favoritesCount":470,"startDate":"2015-07-04","endDate":"2015-09-19","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":194,"ratingRank":886,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"17+ (violence & profanity)","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10085/tiny.jpg?1435924413","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10085/small.jpg?1435924413","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10085/medium.jpg?1435924413","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10085/large.jpg?1435924413","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10085/original.png?1435924413","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/10085/tiny.jpg?1519181568","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/10085/small.jpg?1519181568","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/10085/large.jpg?1519181568","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/10085/original.png?1519181568","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":12,"episodeLength":25,"totalLength":276,"youtubeVideoId":"mWi2mYklRl4","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":12}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"10982","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:00:41.449Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Gate","lang":"fr","nameType":"official"},{"name":"GATE 自衛隊 彼の地にて, 斯く戦えり","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"main"},{"name":"Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Врата","lang":"ru","nameType":"syn"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":2529,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:00:41.516Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/13/33958.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/13/33958.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Gate","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>A gate appears in Tokyo's Ginza district sometime in the 21st century.

prevalent in the first season.

In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":201,"titles":{"en":"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood","en_jp":"Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Fullmetal Alchemist","ja_jp":"鋼の錬金術師 FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST"},"canonicalTitle":"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood","abbreviatedTitles":["Hagane no Renkinjutsushi (2009)","Fullmetal Alchemist (2009)","FMA","Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Fullmetal Alchemist","Hagaren"],"averageRating":"85.31","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"5312","3":"131","4":"638","5":"94","6":"419","7":"104","8":"7737","9":"130","10":"1035","11":"164","12":"2391","13":"208","14":"18178","15":"489","16":"9266","17":"1053","18":"14160","19":"1189","20":"84626"},"userCount":208394,"favoritesCount":8109,"startDate":"2009-04-05","endDate":"2010-07-04","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":1,"ratingRank":1,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"17+ (violence & profanity)","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3936/tiny.jpg?1419000387","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3936/small.jpg?1419000387","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3936/medium.jpg?1419000387","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3936/large.jpg?1419000387","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3936/original.png?1419000387","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/3936/tiny.jpg?1519181714","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/3936/small.jpg?1519181714","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/3936/large.jpg?1519181714","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/3936/original.jpg?1519181714","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":64,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":1536,"youtubeVideoId":"yb2R1l0O9Zs","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":64}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":2071,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:11:00.691Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/11/28760.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/11/28760.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p><b>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</b> is set in a fictional world where alchemy – the transmutation of raw materials into objects – is science, and the way of life.

Kanade Amakusa, life as a high schooler should have been normal, and it would have been—if he wasn't living with the most ridiculous curse imaginable. “Absolute Choice,\" a system forced upon him by a self-proclaimed god, randomly presents a mental selection of actions that he must act out based on his choice.

video games at home instead. One hot summer day, his childhood friend, Meiko \"Menma\" Honma, appears and pesters him to grant a forgotten wish. He pays her no mind, which annoys her, but he doesn't really care.

His academy rigidly divides up the student body into classes based on the results of tests. The prodigies are in the A class with reclining seats complete with air conditioning, but Akihisa is in F class, the lowest rung of the school ladder which is furnished only with low, decrepit tables and worn-out straw tatami mats.

finds himself sent back several minutes before the accident occurs.

This new threat is rising up to challenge everything the city stands for, and the Handymen will not be able to avoid this coming war.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":90,"titles":{"en":"Gangsta.","en_jp":"Gangsta.","en_us":"Gangsta.","ja_jp":"GANGSTA. ギャングスタ"},"canonicalTitle":"Gangsta.","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"73.74","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"48","3":"0","4":"116","5":"2","6":"201","7":"6","8":"598","9":"16","10":"743","11":"20","12":"1609","13":"54","14":"2732","15":"87","16":"2373","17":"60","18":"1258","19":"17","20":"1878"},"userCount":25763,"favoritesCount":268,"startDate":"2015-07-02","endDate":"2015-09-24","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":279,"ratingRank":2020,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"17+ (violence & profanity)","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8576/tiny.jpg?1433892147","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8576/small.jpg?1433892147","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8576/medium.jpg?1433892147","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8576/large.jpg?1433892147","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8576/original.png?1433892147","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8576/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8576/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8576/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8576/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":12,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":288,"youtubeVideoId":"llcwN3KvuXA","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":12}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"10733","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:11:31.617Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Gangsta","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Gangsta.","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"GANGSTA.","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Гангста","lang":"ru","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Гангстери","lang":"bg","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"ギャングスタ","lang":"ja","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"黑街","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"syn"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":2528,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:11:31.728Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/13/33957.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/13/33957.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Gangsta.","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>In the crime-ridden, mafia-governed city of Ergastulum, Worick and Nicolas are two \"handymen\" known as \"Benriya\" who would take any dirty job from either police or mafia -- for a good price.

In a world where the real and surreal intertwine, Musaigen no Phantom World follows the adventures of a group of friends as they handle the everyday troubles caused by phantoms.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Myriad Colors Phantom World","en_jp":"Musaigen no Phantom World","en_us":"Myriad Colors Phantom World","ja_jp":"無彩限のファントム・ワールド"},"canonicalTitle":"Musaigen no Phantom World","abbreviatedTitles":["Musaigen no Phantom World"],"averageRating":"67.98","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"132","3":"0","4":"178","5":"7","6":"334","7":"11","8":"683","9":"16","10":"948","11":"31","12":"1712","13":"59","14":"2710","15":"79","16":"1548","17":"38","18":"686","19":"13","20":"1020"},"userCount":23061,"favoritesCount":78,"startDate":"2016-01-07","endDate":"2016-03-31","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":333,"ratingRank":4679,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11333/tiny.jpg?1445024983","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11333/small.jpg?1445024983","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11333/medium.jpg?1445024983","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11333/large.jpg?1445024983","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11333/original.png?1445024983","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/11333/tiny.jpg?1519181785","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/11333/small.jpg?1519181785","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/11333/large.jpg?1519181785","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/11333/original.jpg?1519181785","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":13,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":312,"youtubeVideoId":"Kw3bfJk8e-0","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":13}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"11500","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T18:56:55.833Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Musaigen no Phantom World","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"main"},{"name":"Myriad Colors Phantom World","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"無彩限のファントム・ワールド","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":10762,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T18:56:55.988Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/36/90702.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/36/90702.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Musaigen no Phantom World","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>In the near future, spirits and monsters are in full sight.

five students at Yamaboshi Academy realize that there are no clubs where they fit in, they band together to form the Student Cultural Society, or \"StuCS\" for short.

These mysterious places, known as \"Dungeons,\" are said to be the work of Magi, a class of rare magicians, who also help people build their empires by guiding them to a dungeon. Djinns, supernatural beings that rule over the labyrinths, grant successful conquerors access to their immense power and choose them as potential king candidates to rule the world.\r\nHaving spent life in isolation, Aladdin, a kind and young magician, is eager to explore the world upon finally leaving his home behind.

With many more girls popping up his life, all involved with Raku's past somehow, his search for the girl who holds his heart and his promise leads him in more unexpected directions than he expects.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":33,"titles":{"en":"Nisekoi: False Love","en_jp":"Nisekoi","en_us":"Nisekoi: False Love","ja_jp":"ニセコイ"},"canonicalTitle":"Nisekoi","abbreviatedTitles":["Nisekoi"],"averageRating":"77.5","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"156","3":"0","4":"166","5":"4","6":"235","7":"9","8":"842","9":"15","10":"988","11":"45","12":"2229","13":"75","14":"5235","15":"186","16":"6072","17":"144","18":"3536","19":"49","20":"4768"},"userCount":47982,"favoritesCount":980,"startDate":"2014-01-11","endDate":"2014-05-24","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":104,"ratingRank":956,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7821/tiny.jpg?1418180051","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7821/small.jpg?1418180051","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7821/medium.jpg?1418180051","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7821/large.jpg?1418180051","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7821/original.jpg?1418180051","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7821/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7821/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7821/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7821/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":20,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":480,"youtubeVideoId":"Pu-n_4CLXLA","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":20}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"9903","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T18:58:09.601Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"False Love","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Nisekoi","lang":"de","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Nisekoi - False Love","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Nisekoi Amours, mensonges & yakuzas !","lang":"fr","nameType":"official"},{"name":"รักลวงป่วนใจ","lang":"th","nameType":"official"},{"name":"니세코이","lang":"ko","nameType":"official"},{"name":"ニセコイ","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"},{"name":"伪恋","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"official"},{"name":"偽戀","lang":"zh-Hant","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":13992,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T18:58:09.719Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/47/119824.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/47/119824.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Nisekoi","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>Raku Ichijo is an average high school student.

Thus, the pair is forced into an uneasy coexistence and must defend themselves from hostile parasites that hope to eradicate this new threat to their species.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":27,"titles":{"en":"Parasyte -the maxim-","en_jp":"Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu","en_us":"Parasyte -the maxim-","ja_jp":"寄生獣 セイの格率"},"canonicalTitle":"Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu","abbreviatedTitles":["Parasite","Parasitic Beasts","Parasyte"],"averageRating":"83.26","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"1233","3":"11","4":"129","5":"16","6":"121","7":"24","8":"1692","9":"37","10":"581","11":"48","12":"1698","13":"155","14":"7180","15":"435","16":"8073","17":"797","18":"8211","19":"426","20":"18992"},"userCount":83937,"favoritesCount":1678,"startDate":"2014-10-09","endDate":"2015-03-26","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":33,"ratingRank":52,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"Violence, Profanity","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8147/tiny.jpg?1513365783","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8147/small.jpg?1513365783","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8147/medium.jpg?1513365783","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8147/large.jpg?1513365783","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/8147/original.jpg?1513365783","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554},"large":{"width":550,"height":780}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8147/tiny.jpg?1519181075","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8147/small.jpg?1519181075","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8147/large.jpg?1519181075","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/8147/original.jpg?1519181075","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":24,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":null,"youtubeVideoId":"9Oe9umzw1Gc","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":24}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"10272","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T18:58:23.522Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Il Parassita","lang":"it","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Kiseijuu","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"short"},{"name":"Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"main"},{"name":"L`ospite indesiderato","lang":"it","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Parasite","lang":"fr","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Parasyte","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Parasyte -the maxim-","lang":"es","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Parasyte: The Maxim","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Parazit: Mravní zásady života","lang":"cs","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Паразит","lang":"bg","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Паразит: Жизненный принцип","lang":"ru","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Паразит: Основно правило","lang":"bg","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"기생수","lang":"ko","nameType":"official"},{"name":"寄生兽 生命的准则","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"official"},{"name":"寄生獣 セイの格率","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":1964,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T18:58:23.662Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/11/27917.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/11/27917.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Kiseijuu","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>One day, high school boy Shinichi wakes up to find that his hand has been possesses by a talking alien parasite Although he and his parasite are able to form a reluctant symbiotic relationship of sorts, the other parasites on Earth have taken over their hosts' bodies completely.

Japan. The government is shattered by their inability to act, and the police are left frantically searching for ways to crack down the perpetrators. The public are clueless—until, six months later, a strange video makes its way onto the internet.

The nations of JIOR, ARUS, and Dorssia have set up colonies made of individual modules in space, each serving to house more than half of mankind.

Yozakura Quartet is actually not one, but two worlds: one of humans, and one of youkai. Despite appearing mostly human, youkai may have animal like physical traits, along with a number of special abilities. Normally youkai are confined to their world, but some have found their way into the realm of humanity.

\"Neighbors,\" malicious beings impervious to traditional weaponry.

Eita sees through the confession, causing Masuzu to admit that she only did so because having a boyfriend would stop people from asking her out daily. She finds love to be just as much of a hindrance as he does, so by pretending to date, they can stave off advances from everyone else.\r\nEita refuses on the grounds that his classmates will be jealous, but Masuzu blackmails him by revealing that she has his journal and will post it online for everyone to see if he betrays her. Thus begins Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru, a story that follows Eita coping with his new \"relationship\" and the complications that arise from it.","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Oreshura","en_jp":"Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru","en_us":"Oreshura","ja_jp":"俺の彼女と幼なじみが修羅場すぎる"},"canonicalTitle":"Oreshura","abbreviatedTitles":["Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru"],"averageRating":"70.95","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"78","3":"0","4":"142","5":"3","6":"206","7":"8","8":"525","9":"16","10":"809","11":"29","12":"1854","13":"42","14":"3062","15":"62","16":"2523","17":"34","18":"844","19":"9","20":"1130"},"userCount":23117,"favoritesCount":158,"startDate":"2013-01-06","endDate":"2013-03-31","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":332,"ratingRank":3267,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7162/tiny.jpg?1445611095","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7162/small.jpg?1445611095","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7162/medium.jpg?1445611095","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7162/large.jpg?1445611095","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7162/original.jpg?1445611095","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7162/tiny.jpg?1519183870","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7162/small.jpg?1519183870","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7162/large.jpg?1519183870","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7162/original.jpg?1519183870","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":13,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":299,"youtubeVideoId":"NV-fkpq_ZwQ","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":13}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"9305","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:01:17.559Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Have Too Much Relationship Difficulties","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"main"},{"name":"OreShura","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"내 여자친구와 소꿉친구가 너무 아수라장","lang":"ko","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"俺の彼女と幼なじみが修羅場すぎる","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"},{"name":"俺修羅","lang":"ja","nameType":"short"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":17086,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-13T19:01:17.677Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/57/143529.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/57/143529.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Oreshura","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>The protagonist, Eita Kidou, is a high school freshman with excellent grades and a disdain for love.
