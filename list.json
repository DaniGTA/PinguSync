With only a murky recollection of what happened right before he logged in, he starts to wander around, searching for clues.\r\n\r\nHe comes upon an enormous, pitch dark tree (the Gigas Cedar), where he encounters a boy. \"My name is Eugeo. Nice to meet you, Kirito.\" Although he is supposedly a resident of the virtual world – an NPC – the boy shows the same array of emotions as any human being.\r\n\r\nAs Kirito bonds with Eugeo, he continues to search for a way to log out of this world. Meanwhile, he remembers a certain memory deep down within him. He remembers racing through the mountains with Eugeo as a child... A memory that he should not have in the first place.\r\n\r\nAnd in this memory, he sees someone other than Eugeo, a young blond girl. Her name is Alice.

beautiful masterpiece about time, the thread of fate, and the hearts of two young souls.\r\n\r\nThe day the stars fell, two lives changed forever. High schoolers Mitsuha and Taki are complete strangers living separate lives. But one night, they suddenly switch places. Mitsuha wakes up in Taki’s body, and he in hers. This bizarre occurrence continues to happen randomly, and the two must adjust their lives around each other. Yet, somehow, it works. They build a connection and communicate by leaving notes, messages, and more importantly, an imprint.\r\n\r\nWhen a dazzling comet lights up the night’s sky, it dawns on them.

High schoolers Mitsuha and Taki are complete strangers living separate lives. But one night, they suddenly switch places. Mitsuha wakes up in Taki’s body, and he in hers. This bizarre occurrence continues to happen randomly, and the two must adjust their lives around each other. Yet, somehow, it works. They build a connection and communicate by leaving notes, messages, and more importantly, an imprint.\r\n\r\nWhen a dazzling comet lights up the night’s sky, it dawns on them. They want something more from this connection—a chance to meet, an opportunity to truly know each other. Tugging at the string of fate, they try to find a way to each other. But distance isn’t the only thing keeping them apart. Is their bond strong enough to face the cruel irony of time?

They unexpectedly meet when Chitoge hops a wall and knees Raku in the face. After she runs off, Raku realizes he has lost his pendant which was given to him by his childhood sweetheart with whom he made a secret promise. After discovering Chitoge is a new transfer student in his class, he forces her to help him look for the pendant. During the search, they begin to dislike each other.\r\n\r\nUpon returning home, Raku learns that the Shuei-Gumi and Beehive gangs have agreed to settle their feud by pairing their leaders' children. Raku learns that his girlfriend-to-be is none other than Chitoge. For the next three years, they must pretend to be in a relationship to maintain peace between the gangs. This turns out to be quite a challenging task, not only because of their hatred for one another, but also because Raku has a crush on another schoolmate, Kosaki Onodera, whom he secretly wishes was the girl who bears the key to his pendant. Various developments complicate the situation, including Chitoge's over-protective bodyguard, a female hitman, a girl who claims to be Raku's fiancée, and the existence of multiple keys.","lastUpdated":1561315841,"airsDayOfWeek":"Saturday","airsTime":"02:00 am","rating":"","imdbId":"tt3115338","zap2itId":"","added":"2013-11-25 16:26:02","addedBy":356189,"siteRating":8.2,"siteRatingCount":13,"slug":"nisekoi"}},"publicScore":8.2}],"packageId":"","id":"wmj2yKImtCmO3SjZz8H88pxmY0VFa4","lastUpdate":1568235107617,"lastInfoUpdate":1568235477840,"seasonDetectionType":"Name","canSync":false,"cachedSeason":2},{"listProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":19163,"fullInfo":true,"provider":"AniList","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:51:47.617Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-18T16:19:16.526Z","covers":[{"url":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/nx19163-eHXj3mNRaOXt.jpg","size":2},{"url":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/nx19163-eHXj3mNRaOXt.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[{"url":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/19163-AMxCNgJINc2F.jpg","size":2}],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Date A Live II","lang":"x-jap","nameType":"official"},{"name":"デート・ア・ライブⅡ","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[20767],"prequelIds":[17641],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":"","releaseYear":2014,"score":0,"rawEntry":{"id":20733119,"score":0,"scoreRaw":0,"progress":10,"progressVolumes":null,"repeat":0,"private":false,"priority":0,"notes":null,"hiddenFromStatusLists":false,"startedAt":{"year":null,"month":null,"day":null},"completedAt":{"year":2018,"month":3,"day":2},"updatedAt":1527556526,"createdAt":1519941331,"media":{"id":19163,"title":{"romaji":"Date A Live II","english":null,"native":"デート・ア・ライブⅡ","userPreferred":"Date A Live II"},"format":"TV","type":"ANIME","status":"FINISHED","episodes":10,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"PREQUEL"},{"relationType":"ADAPTATION"},{"relationType":"SEQUEL"},{"relationType":"SEQUEL"},{"relationType":"PREQUEL"}],"nodes":[{"id":17641},{"id":67523},{"id":20767},{"id":100722},{"id":15583}]},"startDate":{"year":2014,"month":4,"day":12},"endDate":{"year":2014,"month":6,"day":14},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/19163-AMxCNgJINc2F.jpg","coverImage":{"large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/nx19163-eHXj3mNRaOXt.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/nx19163-eHXj3mNRaOXt.jpg"}}},"watchProgress":[{"episode":1,"playCount":1},{"episode":2,"playCount":1},{"episode":3,"playCount":1},{"episode":4,"playCount":1},{"episode":5,"playCount":1},{"episode":6,"playCount":1},{"episode":7,"playCount":1},{"episode":8,"playCount":1},{"episode":9,"playCount":1},{"episode":10,"playCount":1}],"watchStatus":2,"episodes":10},{"version":1,"id":70005,"fullInfo":true,"provider":"Trakt","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:58:04.334Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Date A Live","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"date-a-live","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":"","releaseYear":2013,"rawEntry":{"title":"Date A Live","year":2013,"ids":{"trakt":70005,"slug":"date-a-live","tvdb":264663,"imdb":"tt2575684","tmdb":46004,"tvrage":null}}},{"version":1,"id":"7864","fullInfo":false,"provider":"Kitsu","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:58:04.650Z","lastExternalChange":"2019-09-11T20:19:52.931Z","covers":[{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7864/original.jpg?1408462678","size":1},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7864/tiny.jpg?1408462678","size":5},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7864/small.jpg?1408462678","size":4},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7864/large.jpg?1408462678","size":2}],"banners":[{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7864/original.png","size":1},{"url":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7864/small.jpg","size":5}],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Date A Live II","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"デート・ア・ライブⅡ","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"date-a-live-ii","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"},{"name":"Date A Live 2nd Season","lang":"abbreviatedTitles","nameType":"unkown"}],"overviews":[{"content":"Shido Itsuka, who used to be a normal high school student at Raizen High, meets the first Spirit, Tohka, and awakens his power to \"seal the Spirit's power\".

Called NerveGear, it was the first full-dive system and with it, came endless possibilities to VRMMORPGs.<br><br>\n\nIn 2026, a new machine called the Augma is developed to compete against the NerveGear and its successor, the Amusphere. A next-gen wearable device, the Augma doesn't have a full-dive function like its predecessors. Instead, it uses Augmented Reality to get players into the game.

In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle.

When she's not attending her first year of high school, she even invents new flavors and varieties for Tama-ya, her family's mochi shop. School and growing up, on the other hand, are some things that she's still trying to find the right recipe for. But with the help of her best friends Kanna and Midori, two girls whose parents run businesses in the same shopping district, Tamako's determined to make the best of things.

self-absorbed mage in a world of wands, cloaks, and royalty. Although she studies at Tristain Academy, a prestigious school for magicians, she has a major problem: Louise is unable to cast magic properly, earning her the nickname of \"Louise the Zero\" from her classmates.\r\nWhen the first year students are required to perform a summoning ritual, Louise's summoning results in a catastrophic explosion!

in the bathroom is not the best way to make a good first impression, which Basara Toujou learns the hard way.

What began as a simple murder is now leading towards a full blown war between Kings with the very fate of the world at stake. \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"K","en_jp":"K","en_us":"K","ja_jp":"K"},"canonicalTitle":"K","abbreviatedTitles":["K-Project","K -eine weitere Geschichte-"],"averageRating":"74.7","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"126","3":"1","4":"227","5":"4","6":"281","7":"14","8":"798","9":"10","10":"885","11":"21","12":"2233","13":"71","14":"3890","15":"86","16":"3877","17":"81","18":"1986","19":"23","20":"3109"},"userCount":37031,"favoritesCount":596,"startDate":"2012-10-05","endDate":"2012-12-28","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":159,"ratingRank":1664,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7125/tiny.jpg?1448930694","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7125/small.jpg?1448930694","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7125/medium.jpg?1448930694","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7125/large.jpg?1448930694","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/7125/original.jpg?1448930694","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7125/tiny.jpg?1519181334","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7125/small.jpg?1519181334","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7125/large.jpg?1519181334","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/7125/original.jpg?1519181334","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":13,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":312,"youtubeVideoId":"M8PR0FuTJBI","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":13}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"9043","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:55:38.873Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"K","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"},{"name":"K Project","lang":"de","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"K-Project","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"KTV","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Project Key","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":5192,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:55:39.049Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/21/54664.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/21/54664.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"K","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>Set in a world where history has taken a slightly different course from the one we're familiar with, K follows the story of a young boy whose life is caught in a psychic war between seven kings.</p><p>Ashinaka High School is known for its unique setting: the entire campus is built on an island.

something of equal value must be lost.\"\r\n\r\nAlchemy is bound by this Law of Equivalent Exchange—something the young brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one forbidden act of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor.

After the girl helps Haruyuki overcome the bullies that torment him, he vows to help her realize her goal, and so begins the duo's fight to reach the top.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":73,"titles":{"en":"Accel World","en_jp":"Accel World","en_us":"Accel World","ja_jp":"アクセル・ワールド"},"canonicalTitle":"Accel World","abbreviatedTitles":["Accelerated World"],"averageRating":"73.13","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"225","3":"4","4":"336","5":"5","6":"376","7":"9","8":"914","9":"28","10":"1166","11":"21","12":"2491","13":"63","14":"4274","15":"86","16":"4609","17":"69","18":"2134","19":"21","20":"2892"},"userCount":37402,"favoritesCount":438,"startDate":"2012-04-07","endDate":"2012-09-22","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":154,"ratingRank":2273,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6590/tiny.jpg?1418662182","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6590/small.jpg?1418662182","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6590/medium.jpg?1418662182","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6590/large.jpg?1418662182","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6590/original.png?1418662182","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6590/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6590/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6590/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6590/original.jpeg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":24,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":576,"youtubeVideoId":"Le80O3zYr0U","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":24}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"8691","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:55:27.520Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Accel World","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"AW","lang":"ja","nameType":"short"},{"name":"Dunia Percepatan","lang":"id","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Ускорен Свят","lang":"bg","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Ускоренный мир","lang":"ru","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"دنیای شتاب","lang":"fa","nameType":"official"},{"name":"액셀 월드","lang":"ko","nameType":"official"},{"name":"アクセル・ワールド","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"},{"name":"加速世界","lang":"zh-Hant","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":4268,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:55:27.611Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/20/51105.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/20/51105.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Accel World","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>The year is 2046.

This act of kindness will change their lives, as they soon find themselves dragged into the shadowy world of government secrecy and conspiracy.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Elfen Lied","en_jp":"Elfen Lied","en_us":"Elfen Lied","ja_jp":"エルフェンリート"},"canonicalTitle":"Elfen Lied","abbreviatedTitles":["Elfen Song","Elfic Song"],"averageRating":"74.12","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"569","3":"13","4":"754","5":"12","6":"727","7":"32","8":"1796","9":"31","10":"1690","11":"70","12":"3750","13":"102","14":"6238","15":"154","16":"6505","17":"120","18":"4107","19":"50","20":"6932"},"userCount":59626,"favoritesCount":1144,"startDate":"2004-07-25","endDate":"2004-10-17","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":71,"ratingRank":1850,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"Mild Nudity","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/201/tiny.jpg?1408440917","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/201/small.jpg?1408440917","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/201/medium.jpg?1408440917","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/201/large.jpg?1408440917","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/201/original.png?1408440917","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/201/tiny.jpg?1519179614","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/201/small.jpg?1519179614","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/201/large.jpg?1519179614","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/201/original.jpg?1519179614","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":13,"episodeLength":25,"totalLength":325,"youtubeVideoId":"IItTqRrRkqI","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":13}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"1544","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:54:21.869Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Älvans Sång - Elfen Lied","lang":"sv","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Canto Elfico","lang":"es","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Elf Şarkısı","lang":"tr","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Elfen Lied","lang":"fr","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Elfen Song","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Elfia pieseň","lang":"sk","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Elfia pieśń","lang":"pl","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Elfic Song","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"elven song","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Pieśń elfów","lang":"pl","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Елфска песен","lang":"bg","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Ельфійська пісня","lang":"uk","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Эльфийская песнь","lang":"ru","nameType":"official"},{"name":"آواز اِلف","lang":"fa","nameType":"official"},{"name":"إلفن ليد","lang":"ar","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"الفن لیت","lang":"fa","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"ایلفن لائیڈ","lang":"ur","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"엘펜리트","lang":"ko","nameType":"official"},{"name":"エルフェンリート","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"},{"name":"变异体少女","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"official"},{"name":"妖精的旋律","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"syn"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":2061,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:54:22.170Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/11/28726.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/11/28726.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Elfen Lied","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p><b>Nyu is a babe in the woods.</b></p><p><b>Lucy is a vicious killer.</b></p><p><b>If only they didn t share the same body!</b></p><p>A strange girl washes up on shore naked, unable to communicate, scared and alone.

In a world where the real and surreal intertwine, Musaigen no Phantom World follows the adventures of a group of friends as they handle the everyday troubles caused by phantoms.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Myriad Colors Phantom World","en_jp":"Musaigen no Phantom World","en_us":"Myriad Colors Phantom World","ja_jp":"無彩限のファントム・ワールド"},"canonicalTitle":"Musaigen no Phantom World","abbreviatedTitles":["Musaigen no Phantom World"],"averageRating":"67.97","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"132","3":"0","4":"178","5":"7","6":"334","7":"11","8":"683","9":"16","10":"949","11":"31","12":"1711","13":"59","14":"2708","15":"79","16":"1548","17":"38","18":"685","19":"13","20":"1019"},"userCount":23048,"favoritesCount":78,"startDate":"2016-01-07","endDate":"2016-03-31","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":333,"ratingRank":4684,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11333/tiny.jpg?1445024983","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11333/small.jpg?1445024983","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11333/medium.jpg?1445024983","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11333/large.jpg?1445024983","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/11333/original.png?1445024983","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/11333/tiny.jpg?1519181785","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/11333/small.jpg?1519181785","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/11333/large.jpg?1519181785","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/11333/original.jpg?1519181785","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":13,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":312,"youtubeVideoId":"Kw3bfJk8e-0","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":13}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"11500","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:53:13.265Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Musaigen no Phantom World","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"main"},{"name":"Myriad Colors Phantom World","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"無彩限のファントム・ワールド","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":10762,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:53:13.351Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/36/90702.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/36/90702.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Musaigen no Phantom World","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>In the near future, spirits and monsters are in full sight.

protagonist, Sakamachi Kinjirou, has the worst case of gynophobia known to man. Just one touch from a girl and his nose bleeds almost uncontrollably. His condition is all thanks to his family of female wrestlers who \"trained\" him a bit too much as a child. Through this tough love, Kinjirou developed a body able to withstand hard blows... as well as an intense fear of the female race. Life with such a handicap is difficult in itself, but after one ominous visit to the school restroom, Kinjirou's semi-peaceful existence shifts into complete chaos.

Just one touch from a girl and his nose bleeds almost uncontrollably. His condition is all thanks to his family of female wrestlers who \"trained\" him a bit too much as a child. Through this tough love, Kinjirou developed a body able to withstand hard blows... as well as an intense fear of the female race. Life with such a handicap is difficult in itself, but after one ominous visit to the school restroom, Kinjirou's semi-peaceful existence shifts into complete chaos. He discovers that the suave Subaru-sama, the bodyguard to the headmaster's daughter Kanade, is actually a girl.

Arata.” With those words, Arata’s uneventful, carefree life ends forever. A black shadow covers the sun and Arata’s entire town is reduced to rubble, all the people in it spirited away by the blackness of the sun in an event called a \"breakdown phenomenon\". As Arata’s memories come flooding back, he realizes he’s been living inside an illusion created by a powerful book of spells.\r\nLilith Asami, a mage dispatched to investigate the phenomenon, gives Arata two choices: hand over the book, or die. Arata chooses the third option: enrolling in the top-secret magic school Royal Biblia Academy.

impression, and maybe even some friends. However, Kodaka discovers he is out of luck when he immediately gets labeled as a violent delinquent due to his blond hair and intimidating expression. Although a month has passed, Kodaka is still alone thanks to his notorious reputation.

To reach their goal, they have to cross pathways with several powerful teams, some of which have one of the five players with godlike abilities, whom Kuroko and Taiga make a pact to defeat.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":-7,"titles":{"en":"Kuroko's Basketball","en_jp":"Kuroko no Basket","en_us":"Kuroko's Basketball","ja_jp":"黒子のバスケ"},"canonicalTitle":"Kuroko no Basket","abbreviatedTitles":["Kuroko no Basuke","KuroBas"],"averageRating":"83.02","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"562","3":"7","4":"70","5":"17","6":"72","7":"5","8":"619","9":"18","10":"425","11":"31","12":"1152","13":"88","14":"4115","15":"204","16":"5476","17":"311","18":"4217","19":"127","20":"9799"},"userCount":49564,"favoritesCount":1437,"startDate":"2012-04-08","endDate":"2012-09-22","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":102,"ratingRank":79,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6595/tiny.jpg?1408458846","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6595/small.jpg?1408458846","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6595/medium.jpg?1408458846","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6595/large.jpg?1408458846","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6595/original.jpg?1408458846","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6595/tiny.jpg?1519181078","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6595/small.jpg?1519181078","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6595/large.jpg?1519181078","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6595/original.jpg?1519181078","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":25,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":600,"youtubeVideoId":"FTUIs_SuQfw","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"episodes":25}],"infoProviderInfos":[{"version":1,"id":"8681","fullInfo":false,"provider":"anidb","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:55:54.264Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[],"banners":[],"mediaType":"UNKOWN","names":[{"name":"Kurobas","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"short"},{"name":"Kuroko no Baske","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"main"},{"name":"Kuroko no Basket","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"kuroko no basket","lang":"fr","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Kuroko no Basuke","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Kuroko`s Basketball","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"The Basketball Which Kuroko Plays","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"THE BASKETBALL WHICH KUROKO PLAYS.","lang":"en","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Баскетбол Куроко","lang":"ru","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"Баскетболът на Куроко","lang":"bg","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"幻影籃球王","lang":"zh-Hant","nameType":"official"},{"name":"影子籃球員","lang":"zh","nameType":"official"},{"name":"黑子的篮球","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"syn"},{"name":"黒バス","lang":"ja","nameType":"short"},{"name":"黒子のバスケ","lang":"ja","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[],"isNSFW":false,"sequelIds":[],"prequelIds":[],"canUpdateWatchProgress":false,"customList":false,"customListName":""},{"version":1,"id":6873,"fullInfo":false,"provider":"tvmaze","lastUpdate":"2019-09-11T20:55:54.343Z","lastExternalChange":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","covers":[{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/25/64851.jpg","size":1},{"url":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/25/64851.jpg","size":3}],"banners":[],"mediaType":"ANIME","names":[{"name":"Kuroko no Basuke","lang":"en","nameType":"official"}],"overviews":[{"content":"<p>The Teiko Middle School Basketball Team.
