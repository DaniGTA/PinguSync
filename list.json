Aoyama talks about the penguins with a young woman who works at the dentist’s office and who has been a friend to him. The woman is referred to only as Onee-san. When Onee-san tosses a soda can one day, it turns into a penguin. Meanwhile, Aoyama’s classmate Uchida has secretly been keeping a penguin, but it hasn’t touched its food for three weeks. When Aoyama and Uchida take it with them on the train, it disappears. Another classmate, a girl named Hamamoto who often plays chess with Aoyama, discovers a strange spherical object in a field on the edge of town.

But with the help of her best friends Kanna and Midori, two girls whose parents run businesses in the same shopping district, Tamako's determined to make the best of things.

the west of Tokyo, in a world where magic is also real. Kamijou Touma's right hand, the Imagine Breaker, can negate all magic, psychic, or divine powers, but not his own bad luck. One day he finds a young girl, Index, hanging on his balcony railing. She turns out to be a nun from the Church of England, and her mind has been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum — all the magical texts the Church has removed from circulation. His encounter leads him to meet others from the secret world of science and magic and right into an adventure where science and magic collide.","lastUpdated":1560147835,"airsDayOfWeek":"Friday","airsTime":"10:00 PM","rating":"TV-14","imdbId":"tt1308089","zap2itId":"","added":"2008-10-06 17:31:21","addedBy":4607,"siteRating":8.6,"siteRatingCount":34,"slug":"a-certain-magical-index"}}}],"packageId":"","id":"oUOub7LKy4gyW2KhU92U0MWX3bP83M","lastUpdate":1566485077480,"lastInfoUpdate":1566484740905,"names":[{"name":"Game of Thrones","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"game-of-thrones","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"},{"name":"Gintama.: Porori-hen","lang":"x-jap","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Gintama.: Slip Arc","lang":"unknown","nameType":"main"},{"name":"銀魂. ポロリ編","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Gintama Season 4 (2017)","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Gintama: Silver Soul","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Gintama: Slip Arc","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Gintama.

Asai Kei and Haruki Misora work for their school's club called \"Houshi\" club, which execute any missions received from the Kanrikyoku. Misora has the ability to reset the world 3 days.

Amid attacks from enemy troops the team visited a variety of places and learnt a lot about the local culture and geography.\r\n\r\n Thanks to their efforts in humanitarian relief, although with some difficulties they were gradually able to reach out to the locals. They even had a cute elf, a sorceress and a demigoddess in their circle of new friends. On the other hand, the major powers outside the Gate such as the United States, China, and Russia were extremely interested in the abundant resources available in the Special Region. They began to exert diplomatic pressure over Japan.\r\n\r\n A suddenly appearing portal to an unknown world—to the major powers it may be no more than a mere asset for toppling the international order. But to our protagonists it is an invaluable opportunity to broaden knowledge, friendship, and ultimately their perspective towards the world.","lastUpdated":1564300448,"airsDayOfWeek":"Friday","airsTime":"","rating":"","imdbId":"tt4958580","zap2itId":"","added":"2015-05-01 15:25:53","addedBy":356189,"siteRating":8.4,"siteRatingCount":31,"slug":"gate"}}}],"packageId":"","id":"SdS0Te6zszeXQP5fgyDIwteetKdkYF","lastUpdate":1566485079709,"lastInfoUpdate":1566483672622,"names":[{"name":"GATE","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"gate","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"},{"name":"Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri","lang":"x-jap","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Gate","lang":"unknown","nameType":"main"},{"name":"GATE(ゲート) 自衛隊 彼の地にて、斯く戦えり","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"GATE 自衛隊 彼の地にて, 斯く戦えり","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Врата","lang":"ru","nameType":"unkown"}],"mediaType":1,"overviews":[{"content":"The military fantasy series begins when a gate appears in Tokyo's Ginza district sometime in the 21st century.

In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass.

Ed's limbs from his body and left Al's soul clinging to a cold suit of armor. To restore what was lost, the brothers scour a war-torn land for the Philosopher's Sto­ne, a fabled relic which grants the ability to perform alchemy in impossible ways.\r\n\r\nThe Elrics are not alone in their search; the corrupt State Military is also eager to harness the artifact's power. So too are the strange Homunculi and their shadowy creator. The mythical gem lures exotic alchemists from distant kingdoms, scarring some deeply enough to inspire murder. As the Elrics find their course altered by these enemies and allies, their purpose remains unchanged – and their bond unbreakable.","lastUpdated":1566129289,"airsDayOfWeek":"Sunday","airsTime":"","rating":"TV-MA","imdbId":"tt1355642","zap2itId":"EP01243612","added":"2009-02-22 16:21:40","addedBy":8920,"siteRating":9.1,"siteRatingCount":549,"slug":"fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood"}}}],"packageId":"","id":"4yRUvAwK4waLPULeIbquih3wsaytbG","lastUpdate":1566485080322,"lastInfoUpdate":1566483215270,"names":[{"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"},{"name":"Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Fullmetal Alchemist","lang":"x-jap","nameType":"official"},{"name":"鋼の錬金術師 FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Alchimistul de Oţel","lang":"ro","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Çelik Simyacı","lang":"tr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"El Alquimista de Acero","lang":"es","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"FMA","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"fma tv","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"FMA1","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"FMA2003","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"fmatv","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Full Matal Alchemist/Stalowy Alchemik","lang":"pl","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Full Metal Alchemist","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Fullmetal","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist","lang":"pt-BR","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist - A Bölcsek kövének nyomában","lang":"hu","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist - Hledání kamene mudrců","lang":"cs","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Giả Kim Thuật","lang":"vi","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Hagane no Renkinjutsushi","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"HagaRen","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"HagaRen TV","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"HnR","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Metal Simyacı","lang":"tr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Metalinis Alchemikas","lang":"lt","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"O Alquimista de Aço","lang":"pt-BR","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Ocelový alchymista","lang":"cs","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Pełno-metalowy alchemik","lang":"pl","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Ο Μεταλλικός Αλχημιστής","lang":"el","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Железният Алхимик","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Металният Алхимик","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Напълно Металния Алхимист","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Сталевий алхімік","lang":"uk","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Стальной алхимик","lang":"ru","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Стоманеният алхимик","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Суцільнометалевий алхімік","lang":"uk","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Челични алхемичар/Čelični alhemičar","lang":"sr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"אלכימאי המתכת","lang":"he","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"פמ\"א","lang":"he","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"الخيميائي المعدني","lang":"ar","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"แขนกลคนแปรธาตุ","lang":"th","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"강철의 연금술사","lang":"ko","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"ハガレン","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"钢之炼金术士","lang":"zh","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"钢之炼金术师","lang":"zh","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"钢炼","lang":"zh","nameType":"unkown"}],"mediaType":1,"overviews":[{"content":"In this world, alchemists are those who study and perform the art of alchemical transmutation—the science of manipulating and transforming matter.

The War of the Holy Grail is a contest in which seven magi summon seven Heroic Spirits to compete to obtain the power of the \"Holy Grail,\" which grants a miracle. After three inconclusive wars for the elusive Holy Grail, the Fourth War commences.<br><br>\nFounded by the Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka families centuries ago, the Einzbern family is determined to achieve success after three successive failures, no matter the cost. As a result, they have elected to bring the hated magus killer, Kiritsugu Emiya, into their ranks, despite his methods and reputation as a skilled mercenary and a hitman who employs whatever he can use to accomplish his goals. Though Kiritsugu had once wanted to become a hero who could save everyone, he has long since abandoned this ideal upon realizing that saving one person comes at the cost of another's life. For the sake of humanity, he will ruthlessly destroy anything and anyone who threatens the peace of others.<br><br>\nHowever, Kiritsugu finds himself deeply torn between the love he has found for his new family&mdash;his wife Irisviel and their daughter Illya&mdash;and what he must do to obtain the Holy Grail. Meanwhile, Kiritsugu's greatest opponent appears in the form of Kirei Kotomine, a priest who cannot find any sense of fulfillment in his life and sets his sights on Kiritsugu as the possible answer to

massive earthquake ravaged Japan's mainland and destroyed most of Tokyo, sinking three-quarters of it into the ocean. Ten years later, the story starts with Igarashi Ganta, a seemingly ordinary, unassuming middle school student attending Nagano Prefecture's middle school. An escapee, a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a simple, normal life. This all changes one day when a strange man covered in blood and crimson armour appears, floating, out of his classroom windows. Smirking madly, this Red Man massacres Ganta's entire class and, instead of killing him, embeds a red crystal shard in his chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is declared the sole suspect and, following a suspiciously quick trial, is sentenced to life imprisonment in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme-park-like prison.","lastUpdated":1563152640,"airsDayOfWeek":"","airsTime":"","rating":"TV-MA","imdbId":"tt1909447","zap2itId":"EP01570752","added":"2011-04-16 14:16:26","addedBy":39061,"siteRating":7.4,"siteRatingCount":228,"slug":"deadman-wonderland"}}}],"packageId":"","id":"x2HybgTnMysUNuTD1wNqL6iwFbEF2S","lastUpdate":1566485081081,"lastInfoUpdate":1566483361181,"names":[{"name":"Deadman Wonderland","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"deadman-wonderland","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"},{"name":null,"lang":"unknown","nameType":"main"},{"name":"デッドマン・ワンダーランド","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"dmw","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"dw","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"dwl","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Країна чудес смертників","lang":"uk","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Мъртвата Страна на Чудесата","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Страна чудес смертников","lang":"ru","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"デッドマンワンダーランド","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"}],"mediaType":1,"overviews":[{"content":"Ganta is the only survivor after a mysterious man in red slaughters a classroom full of teenagers.

diclonius, otherwise known as a two-horned human, are mutants of the human species, and may well be the next step in human evolution. The diclonius have horns and strong telekinetic powers represented by \"vectors\". However with this great power, they can easily destroy the human race. Fearful of their power, humans quarantined the diclonius into secret research facilities to study. However, in a freak accident, a enraged female diclonius escaped, killing many guards in the process. While escaping, she is shot in the head, and falls into the ocean. As a result she has waves of amnesia. Later, she washes ashore. There, she meets two people named Kouta and Yuka, who name the female diclonius \"Nyuu\", after the only word she can say. They decide to watch after her, but of course, the research facility can't have this, and begin trying to retrieve her by any means necessary.","lastUpdated":1564282367,"airsDayOfWeek":"","airsTime":"","rating":"TV-MA","imdbId":"tt0480489","zap2itId":"","added":"","addedBy":null,"siteRating":8.2,"siteRatingCount":423,"slug":"elfen-lied"}}}],"packageId":"","id":"IgelOFxgpHtvQqZJAqmf0EfUaRaeCD","lastUpdate":1566485081310,"lastInfoUpdate":1566483314030,"names":[{"name":"Elfen Lied","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"elfen-lied","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"},{"name":"エルフェンリート","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Älvans Sång - Elfen Lied","lang":"sv","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Canto Elfico","lang":"es","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Elf Şarkısı","lang":"tr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Elfen Song","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Elfia pieseň","lang":"sk","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Elfia pieśń","lang":"pl","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Elfic Song","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"elven song","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Pieśń elfów","lang":"pl","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Елфска песен","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Ельфійська пісня","lang":"uk","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Эльфийская песнь","lang":"ru","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"آواز اِلف","lang":"fa","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"إلفن ليد","lang":"ar","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"الفن لیت","lang":"fa","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"ایلفن لائیڈ","lang":"ur","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"엘펜리트","lang":"ko","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"变异体少女","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"妖精的旋律","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"unkown"}],"mediaType":1,"overviews":[{"content":"The Diclonius, a mutated homosapien that is said to be selected by God and will eventually become the destruction of mankind, possess two horns on their heads and have a \"sixth sense\" which gives them telekinetic abilities.

One day, on the way home from class, Light stumbles upon a dark notebook with \"Death Note\" written on the front. Intrigued by its appearance, Light reads the first few sentences, only to find out that it states that anyone whose name is written inside will die. Discarding it as a joke, Light continues his daily activities. Soon after though, his human curiosity takes the better of him and prompts Light to try the notebook, discovering the truth behind first sentence. Now, with power in his hands, Yagami Light is on a quest to change the world and become God of the New World. His path to holy status won't be easy however, as another genius, known as L, is working against Light's beliefs and Light himself.

in Sakurasou, the dormitory for problem children at Sorata's school.

thing he expects is to be wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world. Things aren't looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.\r\n\r\nHowever, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.","lastUpdated":1562010759,"airsDayOfWeek":"Monday","airsTime":"1:00 AM","rating":"TV-MA","imdbId":"tt5607616","zap2itId":"","added":"2015-12-29
