When she's not attending her first year of high school, she even invents new flavors and varieties for Tama-ya, her family's mochi shop. School and growing up, on the other hand, are some things that she's still trying to find the right recipe for. But with the help of her best friends Kanna and Midori, two girls whose parents run businesses in the same shopping district, Tamako's determined to make the best of things. It's complicated though, especially when it comes to emotions and her relationship with her best boy friend Mochizou, whose family runs a rival mochi shop. And lately, Midori's been feeling a little odd about her feelings towards Tamako as well. And what's with up with that strange bird fluttering around, the one that speaks fluent Japanese? It's all very mysterious and overwhelming, but at least Tamako always has one thing she can count on: No matter if your day's been good or bad, there's certain to be something sugary and delicious waiting at the end of every adventure whenever you take a walk through Tamako Market!<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai

With the appearance of the Gates emerged Contractors, who, in exchange for their humanity, are granted supernatural abilities.\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese city surrounding Hell’s Gate, Section 4 Chief Misaki Kirihara finds herself at odds with an infamous Contractor codenamed Hei. Called \"Black Reaper\" in the underground world, Hei, like his associates, undertakes missions for the mysterious and ruthless Syndicate while slowly peeling back the dark layers covering a nefarious plot that threatens the very existence of Contractors.\r\n\r\nFrom the mind of Tensai Okamura comes a sci-fi thriller taking the form of a subtle exposé on a war in which political positions and justice have no sway—a war waged exclusively in the shadows.","lastUpdated":1564282260,"airsDayOfWeek":"Monday","airsTime":"","rating":"TV-14","imdbId":"tt0995941","zap2itId":"","added":"","addedBy":null,"siteRating":8.9,"siteRatingCount":46,"slug":"darker-than-black"}}}],"packageId":"","id":"MyFptBHUjNUIMO7xjwIWmMxu8E4liN","lastUpdate":1566224715457,"lastInfoUpdate":1566223766569,"names":[{"name":"DARKER THAN BLACK","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"darker-than-black","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"},{"name":"Darker than BLACK: Kuro no Keiyakusha","lang":"x-jap","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Darker than Black","lang":"unknown","nameType":"main"},{"name":"Darker than BLACK -黒の契約者-","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Brama piekieł","lang":"pl","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Ciemniejszy od czerni","lang":"pl","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Czarny Kontraktor","lang":"pl","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker Than Black","lang":"pt","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker than BLACK -흑의 계약자-","lang":"ko","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"DARKER THAN BLACK -黑之契約者-","lang":"zh-Hant","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"DARKER THAN BLACK 黒の契約者","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker Than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker than Black: The Black Contractor","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"DtB","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"dtb1","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Mai întunecat ca negrul","lang":"ro","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Mroczny Kontraktor","lang":"pl","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Zifiri Karanlık","lang":"tr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"По-тъмно от черното","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Светът на мрака","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Темнее чёрного","lang":"ru","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Темніше за чорне","lang":"uk","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"אפל משחור","lang":"he","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"أحلك من السواد","lang":"ar","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"黑之契约者","lang":"zh","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker than BLACK: Ryuusei no Gemini","lang":"x-jap","nameType":"official"},{"name":"Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor","lang":"unknown","nameType":"main"},{"name":"DARKER THAN BLACK 流星の双子","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker than BLACK -유성의 제미니-","lang":"ko","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"DARKER THAN BLACK -流星之雙子-","lang":"zh-Hant","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker than Black 2","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker than Black Gaiden","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker than Black OVA","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"DARKER THAN BLACK 流星の双子[ジェミニ]","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker Than Black: Gemini of the Meteor","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Darker Than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"dtb2","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"dtbrng","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Tamsiau už Juodą: Meteoro Dvyniai","lang":"lt","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Zifiri Karanlık 2","lang":"tr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Близнюки метеора","lang":"uk","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"По-тъмно от черното: Близнаците на Метеора","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Темнее черного: Близнецы и падающая звезда","lang":"ru","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Темніше чорного: Близнюки метеора","lang":"uk","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"黑之契约者-流星的双子-","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"unkown"}],"mediaType":1,"overviews":[{"content":"In Tokyo, an impenetrable field known as \"Hell's Gate\" appeared ten years ago.

Ed's limbs from his body and left Al's soul clinging to a cold suit of armor. To restore what was lost, the brothers scour a war-torn land for the Philosopher's Sto­ne, a fabled relic which grants the ability to perform alchemy in impossible ways.\r\n\r\nThe Elrics are not alone in their search; the corrupt State Military is also eager to harness the artifact's power. So too are the strange Homunculi and their shadowy creator. The mythical gem lures exotic alchemists from distant kingdoms, scarring some deeply enough to inspire murder. As the Elrics find their course altered by these enemies and allies, their purpose remains unchanged – and their bond unbreakable.","lastUpdated":1566129289,"airsDayOfWeek":"Sunday","airsTime":"","rating":"TV-MA","imdbId":"tt1355642","zap2itId":"EP01243612","added":"2009-02-22 16:21:40","addedBy":8920,"siteRating":9.1,"siteRatingCount":549,"slug":"fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood"}}}],"packageId":"","id":"bI8MDf6QI0i2YJ8AjDZowoJ8WCsbwe","lastUpdate":1566224715993,"lastInfoUpdate":1566223229559,"names":[{"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood","lang":"en","nameType":"official"},{"name":"fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood","lang":"slug","nameType":"slug"},{"name":"Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Fullmetal Alchemist","lang":"x-jap","nameType":"official"},{"name":"鋼の錬金術師 FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST","lang":"jap","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Alchimistul de Oţel","lang":"ro","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Çelik Simyacı","lang":"tr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"El Alquimista de Acero","lang":"es-LA","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"FMA","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"fma tv","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"FMA1","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"FMA2003","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"fmatv","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Full Matal Alchemist/Stalowy Alchemik","lang":"pl","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Full Metal Alchemist","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Fullmetal","lang":"en","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist","lang":"ro","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist - A Bölcsek kövének nyomában","lang":"hu","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist - Hledání kamene mudrců","lang":"cs","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Giả Kim Thuật","lang":"vi","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Hagane no Renkinjutsushi","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"HagaRen","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"HagaRen TV","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"HnR","lang":"x-jat","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Metal Simyacı","lang":"tr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Metalinis Alchemikas","lang":"lt","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"O Alquimista de Aço","lang":"pt-BR","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Ocelový alchymista","lang":"cs","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Pełno-metalowy alchemik","lang":"pl","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Ο Μεταλλικός Αλχημιστής","lang":"el","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Железният Алхимик","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Металният Алхимик","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Напълно Металния Алхимист","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Сталевий алхімік","lang":"uk","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Стальной алхимик","lang":"ru","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Стоманеният алхимик","lang":"bg","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Суцільнометалевий алхімік","lang":"uk","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"Челични алхемичар/Čelični alhemičar","lang":"sr","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"אלכימאי המתכת","lang":"he","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"פמ\"א","lang":"he","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"الخيميائي المعدني","lang":"ar","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"แขนกลคนแปรธาตุ","lang":"th","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"강철의 연금술사","lang":"ko","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"ハガレン","lang":"ja","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"钢之炼金术士","lang":"zh","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"钢之炼金术师","lang":"zh-Hans","nameType":"unkown"},{"name":"钢炼","lang":"zh","nameType":"unkown"}],"mediaType":1,"overviews":[{"content":"In this world, alchemists are those who study and perform the art of alchemical transmutation—the science of manipulating and transforming matter.
