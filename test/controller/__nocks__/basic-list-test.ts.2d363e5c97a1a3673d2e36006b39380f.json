Things aren't looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.\n\nHowever, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

Two days later, Beatrice is sent to see what's bothering him; she also states that he has a strong smell of witch. Subaru asks her to guarantee his safety at the fourth night, which she grants by making a contract with him. On that night, he recalls Rem's attack on him, and feels his hands held by other hands, and then wakes up in Beatrice's room. He gets through the night in this room safely. In the next morning, he walks out of the room, and finds that Rem is dead, leaving Ram in grief. Roswaal states that she died of exhaustion, possibly caused by a curse. He and Emilia ask for clues for Rem's loss, which Subaru is unable to provide. Ram suspects Subaru and tries to attack him, but Beatrice protects him because of the contract. Subaru runs away from the mansion and goes to a cliff. Beatrice approaches him and informs him that the maid twin is incomplete with the loss of one, and offers to help him to escape the territory. Subaru realizes that it was the twin that held his hands in his sleep. Then Ram also arrives, swearing to kill Subaru. Believing that his own cowardice has led to Rem's tragedy, and despite Beatrice's protection, Subaru jumps off the cliff to his death announcing that he will definitely rescue everybody.",

When the three return from the village, Roswaal leaves for the night, which did not happen in the previous timelines. Subaru sees Beatrice to confirm that he was cursed and to locate where it was applied to on his body. Having traced the curse to the dog that bit him, Subaru realizes that the children are in danger and that night, he returns to the village with Rem. The children go missing and the two venture into the forest to find all but one of the missing children, who have been bitten by the dog. While Rem heals the children, Subaru goes searching for the last child and gets attacked by a Mabeast. Subaru defeats the Mabeast, but he gets surrounded by a pack of Mabeasts and Rem arrives to clear a path. The two run back to the village, but while buying time to get the children to safety, Rem gets overwhelmed. Rem unleashes the demon within her and goes berserk. With Rem about to be killed, Subaru stands in to take the attack.",

Things aren't looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.\n\nHowever, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

Subaru is revived once again in the mansion, and meets Ram and Rem again, with fear. Emilia worries about him, realizing he is in trouble; Subaru tries to tell her about his deaths and revivals, but just as he begins, a black shadow seemingly with hands overwhelms him. Two days later, Beatrice is sent to see what's bothering him; she also states that he has a strong smell of witch. Subaru asks her to guarantee his safety at the fourth night, which she grants by making a contract with him. On that night, he recalls Rem's attack on him, and feels his hands held by other hands, and then wakes up in Beatrice's room. He gets through the night in this room safely. In the next morning, he walks out of the room, and finds that Rem is dead, leaving Ram in grief. Roswaal states that she died of exhaustion, possibly caused by a curse. He and Emilia ask for clues for Rem's loss, which Subaru is unable to provide. Ram suspects Subaru and tries to attack him, but Beatrice protects him because of the contract. Subaru runs away from the mansion and goes to a cliff. Beatrice approaches him and informs him that the maid twin is incomplete with the loss of one, and offers to help him to escape the territory. Subaru realizes that it was the twin that held his hands in his sleep. Then Ram also arrives, swearing to kill Subaru. Believing that his own cowardice has led to Rem's tragedy, and despite Beatrice's protection, Subaru jumps off the cliff to his death announcing that he will definitely rescue everybody.",

In the next morning, he walks out of the room, and finds that Rem is dead, leaving Ram in grief. Roswaal states that she died of exhaustion, possibly caused by a curse. He and Emilia ask for clues for Rem's loss, which Subaru is unable to provide. Ram suspects Subaru and tries to attack him, but Beatrice protects him because of the contract. Subaru runs away from the mansion and goes to a cliff. Beatrice approaches him and informs him that the maid twin is incomplete with the loss of one, and offers to help him to escape the territory. Subaru realizes that it was the twin that held his hands in his sleep. Then Ram also arrives, swearing to kill Subaru. Believing that his own cowardice has led to Rem's tragedy, and despite Beatrice's protection, Subaru jumps off the cliff to his death announcing that he will definitely rescue everybody.",

Things aren't looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.\n\nHowever, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

Subaru is revived once again in the mansion, and meets Ram and Rem again, with fear. Emilia worries about him, realizing he is in trouble; Subaru tries to tell her about his deaths and revivals, but just as he begins, a black shadow seemingly with hands overwhelms him. Two days later, Beatrice is sent to see what's bothering him; she also states that he has a strong smell of witch. Subaru asks her to guarantee his safety at the fourth night, which she grants by making a contract with him. On that night, he recalls Rem's attack on him, and feels his hands held by other hands, and then wakes up in Beatrice's room. He gets through the night in this room safely. In the next morning, he walks out of the room, and finds that Rem is dead, leaving Ram in grief. Roswaal states that she died of exhaustion, possibly caused by a curse. He and Emilia ask for clues for Rem's loss, which Subaru is unable to provide. Ram suspects Subaru and tries to attack him, but Beatrice protects him because of the contract. Subaru runs away from the mansion and goes to a cliff. Beatrice approaches him and informs him that the maid twin is incomplete with the loss of one, and offers to help him to escape the territory. Subaru realizes that it was the twin that held his hands in his sleep. Then Ram also arrives, swearing to kill Subaru. Believing that his own cowardice has led to Rem's tragedy, and despite Beatrice's protection, Subaru jumps off the cliff to his death announcing that he will definitely rescue everybody.",

Two days later, Beatrice is sent to see what's bothering him; she also states that he has a strong smell of witch. Subaru asks her to guarantee his safety at the fourth night, which she grants by making a contract with him. On that night, he recalls Rem's attack on him, and feels his hands held by other hands, and then wakes up in Beatrice's room. He gets through the night in this room safely. In the next morning, he walks out of the room, and finds that Rem is dead, leaving Ram in grief. Roswaal states that she died of exhaustion, possibly caused by a curse. He and Emilia ask for clues for Rem's loss, which Subaru is unable to provide. Ram suspects Subaru and tries to attack him, but Beatrice protects him because of the contract. Subaru runs away from the mansion and goes to a cliff. Beatrice approaches him and informs him that the maid twin is incomplete with the loss of one, and offers to help him to escape the territory. Subaru realizes that it was the twin that held his hands in his sleep. Then Ram also arrives, swearing to kill Subaru. Believing that his own cowardice has led to Rem's tragedy, and despite Beatrice's protection, Subaru jumps off the cliff to his death announcing that he will definitely rescue everybody.",

Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks.

Two days later, Beatrice is sent to see what's bothering him; she also states that he has a strong smell of witch. Subaru asks her to guarantee his safety at the fourth night, which she grants by making a contract with him.

In the next morning, he walks out of the room, and finds that Rem is dead, leaving Ram in grief. Roswaal states that she died of exhaustion, possibly caused by a curse. He and Emilia ask for clues for Rem's loss, which Subaru is unable to provide. Ram suspects Subaru and tries to attack him, but Beatrice protects him because of the contract. Subaru runs away from the mansion and goes to a cliff. Beatrice approaches him and informs him that the maid twin is incomplete with the loss of one, and offers to help him to escape the territory. Subaru realizes that it was the twin that held his hands in his sleep. Then Ram also arrives, swearing to kill Subaru. Believing that his own cowardice has led to Rem's tragedy, and despite Beatrice's protection, Subaru jumps off the cliff to his death announcing that he will definitely rescue everybody.",
