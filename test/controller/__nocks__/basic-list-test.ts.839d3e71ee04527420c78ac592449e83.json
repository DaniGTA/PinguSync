While cleaning the academy's tower as part of their punishment, the two girls witness a horde of dragons carrying off the Sorcerer's Stone. Strangely, the academy staff does not react to this theft, instead accidentally revealing that this is part of an anticipated prophecy involving a dragon. Lotte recalls the legend of a white dragon who resides in the nearby Ruins of Rastaban, which inspires Akko and Amanda to retrieve it themselves. Accompanied by their friends, they proceed to the ruins, where they discover that the culprit is a loan shark dragon named Fafnir, who has repossessed the Sorcerer's Stone from Luna Nova for their failure to pay off their debt. Luckily, Diana is able to decipher that Fafnir's promissory note (written in dragon language) does not actually mention paying back interest, meaning Fafnir had tricked the school into paying back more than they actually owed. Caught in his deception, Fafnir is forced into nullifying the contract and returning the Sorcerer's Stone to Luna Nova.",

Interested in the relay's prize offerings, Lotte and Sucy decide to help train Akko to try and ride her broom, and on the day of the relay Sucy uses her concoctions to give her team an early start and Akko an alternate means of using her broom. Meanwhile, Amanda O'Neill steals the Ryuuseimaru to use for herself, only for it to break loose and run wild, soon running into Akko. Despite being dragged around the world and shaken off, Akko manages to take ahold of the Ryuuseimaru and go neck and neck against Diana, only to fall off again when it breaks its seal and flies away, leading her to place second in the relay.

Strangely, the academy staff does not react to this theft, instead accidentally revealing that this is part of an anticipated prophecy involving a dragon. Lotte recalls the legend of a white dragon who resides in the nearby Ruins of Rastaban, which inspires Akko and Amanda to retrieve it themselves. Accompanied by their friends, they proceed to the ruins, where they discover that the culprit is a loan shark dragon named Fafnir, who has repossessed the Sorcerer's Stone from Luna Nova for their failure to pay off their debt. Luckily, Diana is able to decipher that Fafnir's promissory note (written in dragon language) does not actually mention paying back interest, meaning Fafnir had tricked the school into paying back more than they actually owed. Caught in his deception, Fafnir is forced into nullifying the contract and returning the Sorcerer's Stone to Luna Nova.",

After getting into a fight with Hannah and Barbara, Akko is threatened with expulsion from Luna Nova should she fail her final exam, which requires an understanding of fish language. While attempting to bribe the fish philosophy teacher, Pisces, Akko accidentally drops her down a drain into the school's sewage system. Transforming into a merman to search for him, Akko comes across a sad fish and chooses to use her emergency magic reserve to free her family from a poacher's trap, coming across Pisces in the process. When Akko is once again faced with expulsion for her actions, Pisces gives her an A in his exam for helping the fish family while Ursula vouches that, despite the gap between her and her classmates, Akko's magic has improved considerably since her enrollment. After the fish Akko rescued are revealed to be an endangered species, her expulsion is cancelled and she is given a less severe punishment instead.",

Later, Akko goes with Lotte to a magic item café where they come across a legendary broom known as the Ryuuseimaru (Shooting Star) that has been sealed off for being too temperamental. Interested in the relay's prize offerings, Lotte and Sucy decide to help train Akko to try and ride her broom, and on the day of the relay Sucy uses her concoctions to give her team an early start and Akko an alternate means of using her broom. Meanwhile, Amanda O'Neill steals the Ryuuseimaru to use for herself, only for it to break loose and run wild, soon running into Akko. Despite being dragged around the world and shaken off, Akko manages to take ahold of the Ryuuseimaru and go neck and neck against Diana, only to fall off again when it breaks its seal and flies away, leading her to place second in the relay.

Lotte recalls the legend of a white dragon who resides in the nearby Ruins of Rastaban, which inspires Akko and Amanda to retrieve it themselves. Accompanied by their friends, they proceed to the ruins, where they discover that the culprit is a loan shark dragon named Fafnir, who has repossessed the Sorcerer's Stone from Luna Nova for their failure to pay off their debt. Luckily, Diana is able to decipher that Fafnir's promissory note (written in dragon language) does not actually mention paying back interest, meaning Fafnir had tricked the school into paying back more than they actually owed.
